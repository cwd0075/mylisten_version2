00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.590

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.190
There is nothing good about a day,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.190
when one is roused,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.690

The prisoner named,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.390

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.490

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.290
Father.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.590
If I'm contemplating silence,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.690
it makes no difference to the instruction.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.390
I must not be disturbed.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.290

Broken women old talk of trial normally today?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.090

No, you understood correctly.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.990
She killed an officer in the kingsguard.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.990
It is a serious crime,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.990
she is good.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.290
Could not cure good.

And what would you like me to do about this information

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.890
Quasimodo?

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.390
Her intrinsic goodness.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.790
Is there someone for me to inform of this?

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.890
Oh, I don't know.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.490
No.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.390
You don't do you.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.590
Tomorrow.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.790
I bury the man she killed.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.790
I have a sermon to prepare.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.790
I'd rather you leave me be

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.590

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.890
You did knowingly,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.490
prostitute yourself to and the murder Captain feels.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.590
There is a fly in my courtroom a fly in February.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.290
I've never heard such nonsense.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.290
Does she attract?

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.590
Do you attract flies Mademoiselle?

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.390
No good.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.990
Are we going to present evidence?

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.590
She was found with a murder weapon and caught your

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.190
lordship.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.890
Was she?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.890
Oh my dear,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.390
that's damning evidence speak,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.790

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.590
I loved him.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.190
Loved Phoebus,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.790
I could not hurt him.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.190
I would not hurt him.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.090
It was my flame.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.290
My this go talks prettily.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.390
It was another man.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.690
He was hiding,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.190
he came out of the closet and stopped fevers and he

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.290
climbed out the window and run away.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.490
Pretty nonsense.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.290
But pretty all the same.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.190
She had his blood all over.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.790
I am not guilty of this crime.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.990
I could not be.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.190
I have harmed.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.790
Nothing.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.490
I am not guilty,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.090
of course,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.890
not my dear.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.290
He was the man hiding in the wardrobe with the kitchen

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.290
spoon.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.790
Guilty H is guilty.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.090
I know that is,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.690
what I'll do,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.390
you will be hung

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.990
The Rope until dead.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.390
You are wrong.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.190
I am not a murderer.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.290
I am not taking this shows.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.590
I have no time for this.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.390
You will die.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.790
Mike.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.990
Are you doing with him?

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.590
I'm holding my breath George.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.390
I can see that.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.090
But why?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.290
To see how long I can hold,

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.590
my breath for hello about minutes.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.990

What are you two doing?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.190
I should know not to ask.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.990
The prisoner is ready to be escorted to The Gallows.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.490
So does does that make it a tail?

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.690
What Requiem aeternam Dona Ace Domine?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.090
It looks Perpetual with Chariot.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.090
Yes.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.790
My name is Lieutenant Mikhail,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.490
Leduc.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.190
I am here to tell you of a brave Soldier and Captain,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.790
I fought with Phoebus,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.090
sat with him,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.690
he was a great friend and a great fighter.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.990
His loss for which we are gathered here today,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.390
is not just for his friends.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.890
His fellow soldiers,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.090
his betrothed,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.190
but it is also a loss for Paris for France.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.090
Take me to The Gallows.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.490
Have your powder.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.390
Appeal, a sword.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.390

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.690
Square.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.690
Full waiting for execution.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.090
A sea.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:42.990
When child twisting orange its father Tarzan,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.490

He's sees me.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.090
This is morality.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.390
Respect to the square by refugees as morality,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:02.590
but I watch my weight.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.390
This crowd is a variable or touring the nation,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:19.390
but me but being fast is what easy to work with.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.790
Hands are shaking.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.090
That's why we're home,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.590

Tightly battery.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:46.490
I screamed so loud.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.490

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:32.990
man.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.590
It's his face.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.590
A crooked body breeds,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.090
a crooked line is broken.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.490
The quote,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:14:00.790

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.490
my nose is bleeding.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.190
That's nothing compared to what's gonna happen when

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.290
the sergeant finds out.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.990
You do speak still?

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.890
I can see your face.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.190
It is

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.290
the man in the stocks.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.190
I remember correctly.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.890
Oh right,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.090

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.790
Do you understand me?

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.690
I need to know why I'm here.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.890
I cannot understand.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.990
She speak quick.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.890
I am death.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.590
Oh, she moves the face.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:17.990
So opposite my face she moves her lips slow.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.590
So I understand why

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.590
Am I here?

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.390
they want to kill you,

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.590
I could do what that you

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.190

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.590
Yes.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.190
Thank you.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:49.490
She looks me into too much too much.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.990
Soft.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.690
I need to.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:00.690
I will.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.590
You knew Captain Phoebus.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.290
I can always tell an army man,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.190
my mother.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.990
My mother always told me never to trust a woman who

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.090
uses a handkerchief.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.090
We've got a church hiding him and her it's disgusting

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.390
then.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.790
Let's do something about it.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.590
I asked a friend of the churches,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.990
I did his murderers.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.890
All my life,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.790
that Gypsy will be

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.690
Marble of Kings Saints,

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.290
Bishops monsters,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.090
demons, do not scare me.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.490
The sense of friends plus me,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.590
monsters, God me.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.290
He feel himself.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.990
Scott owes through,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.790

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.090

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.690
you don't see me crowds of angry people outside.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.690
The cathedral know,

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.690
there are crowds,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.790
I just came through them.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.390
Where is he?

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.390
No one's seen him.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.690
Well, it is inside the cathedral and find him find

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.490

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.490
Yes archdeacon.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.190
But first Bolt the door,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.490

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.190
cass centuries been

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.290
The people will not offend the church yet.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:33.890
If they do,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.190
I'd rather have a bolted door to protect me.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.290
He stands the moment sniffing.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:40.690
Yeah.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.990
Does not see me.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.790
I crawl alleys and can't find what I'm seeking and

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.390
return.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.590
I put package of feed her as we treat.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.090
She looks me.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:04.990
Looks me.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.990
She has not finished for my face but the face it.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:20.890
She wraps the cloak scared of it either.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.590
This is clothing for me.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.990
yes, she looks at the body,

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.790

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.390
She colors.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.890
Please, Max do not contain her.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.890
She drops the cloak,

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.990
I have food.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.590
I prefer food.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.490

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.490
Safe food.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.990
Cuz, you know,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.290
why you've done this.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:11.590
You are a good kind just gave me water.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:18.090
You save my life because I gave you water sleep here

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.390

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.390
Quick fist.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.690
Paris is on its knees,

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.790
they say 2000,

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.990
slept in the Square last night,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.190
the deceased was clearly a popular man asked them

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.890
about the Batman.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.590
They'll tell you,

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.890
it me such as well.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.190
He might listen,

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.490
man.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.790
Your negligence has bread.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.590
You're saving.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.190
We need all the soldiers,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.690
we can get control.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.690
These imbeciles,

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.190
are you sure?

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.490
We won't let you down this time.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.290
You're both to be busted to Street crew.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.490
Assigned to the square,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.990
keep it under control.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.090
We'll do our best sir,

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.890
you will do better than that.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:13.390
Watch you sleep I thought it not harm you to have you

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.090
watch?

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.190
My face.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.990
Frightened, you woke.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.390
So my face,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.190
she's forgot play.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.290
You're not fighting me.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.890
I was dreaming of Phoebus his death.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.690
That's no breakfast for you hungry,

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:53.090
but I have present to present but you only keep one.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.390
Is this a game?

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.490
And I show flowers,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.390
two parts,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.690
one beautiful,

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.590
vows that and dying flowers.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.990
The plain ugly.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.390
Fast with beautiful flowers.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.790
She looks at them and me,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.390
I'm just a dancer but I understand your game.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.690
No.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.290
I know who he was,

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.290
what he was.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.890
I know he was a pretty Vaz and underneath was

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.090
But I loved him all the same which isn't to say I couldn't

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.590
love a plane vars.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.390
I just don't.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.090
Yes.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.290
Do you know much about women causing Moto?

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.790
No, not do.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.290
I know men,

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.690
neither people are strange to me.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.890
That don't make sense.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.490
I dance for money.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.490
I entertain them.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.090
But I don't understand them,

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.490
the cathedral not big enough to hide you,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.890
they will find us today.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.490
I could to my father,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.490
is he a good man?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.790
Yes, then all will be.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.490
Well, yes.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:28.390
And I pick up beautiful flowers in plane part and leave

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:28.990
her be

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.490
I'm watching the people outside.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.390
I'll be seeing them.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:44.990
You think they all knew and loved Captain Phoebus?

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.190
I suspect not yet,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.190
they all spent the night out on the street yet they

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.590
are all angry.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:04.290
Why the same reason a crowd gets angry entertainment

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.890
denied, righteous indignation,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.990
pricked, you prevented them an execution,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.290
she killed an officer of the king.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.190
When we asked why you denied them,

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.790
I did not want her to die.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.390
As always.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.390
The Simplicity of your responses is your greatest

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.290
strength, take me to her.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.290
Yes, but

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.490
but,

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:53.390
But this time I did not touch her for you.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.590
I saved her for

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.890
we could not find you last night.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:08.990
No.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.190
when you hiding from me,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.790
do you trust me?

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.690
Yes, she wore my father,

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.390
he turns

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.290
Looks me closely,

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.890
like and fly and Spike.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.090
And take me to her execution,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.890
the wait until they get one.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.390
That's leading with a Tankard in is and I like the look

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.290
of that Leduc,

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.990
but is only a lieutenant,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.690
not like my captain Phoebus,

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.390
she is not looking.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.890
She's danced with back buddy.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:26:59.790
Black

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.390
The window.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.290
You must be the gypsy.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.890
Girl she turns her face drops.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.590
His eyes fire.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.290
Yeah.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.490
You you recognize me.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.890
I don't believe we've met.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.490
I'm the archdeacon of this Cathedral and as such your

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.990
protector, was it murder as father.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.690
He is aware who I didn't read your eyes.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.490
My father looks huh.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.890
Then me this this is who you have me.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.790
Protect my famous Quasimodo.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.090
He must believe me.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.090
You are mistaking me for another

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.790
And I want you all should throw you to the Wolves everybody.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.390
I thought I could pull you down with me your whore.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.590
No, no.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.890
You must not know.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.590
Lock her away Quasimodo.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.890
If he squeals then breaker and leave it to the rat,

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.790
he's crying.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.390
That is your mother.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.690
Her great him myself.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.190
My life and yours is a cheap.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.690
That man is a devil's.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.990
Horrible, no-kill,

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.690
fevers, and would have let me hang for it.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.490
No, yes he is.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.390
And he did that,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:41.990
will you please leave me George jion.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.090
You are policing this Rebel Wilson and I think we both

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:46.690
want the same thing.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.590
An end to this nonsense and a dead gypsy.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:49.990
Girl.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:50.790
Am I wrong?

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:51.790
No, sir.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.990
So why don't you use your powers to get us inside and

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.890
get that girl,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.190
talk to your superiors.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.790
Bring an end to this stupidity.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.390
We are just here to keep order so we have no powers but

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.390
we will get her to understand this.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.990
We will get a good day gentlemen.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.490
Well, I chairman,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.590
man, he touched my shoulder.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.490
I felt Darkness pass through it.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.890
You don't think they want storm the cathedral where

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.090
they, we have neither the Manpower,

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.490
nor the it's simple.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.890
If they do,

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.090
we will let them

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.590
Archdeacon I have a message from the Lord Bishop.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.590
I heard you'd made it through the crowd.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.690
I'm quite impressed was quite a crowd.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.490
What does the Lord Bishop want?

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.290
He had prophesized by you.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.390
I believe the numbers on the Square would decrease

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.190
with time.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.390
We underestimated their Fury all for this girl.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.590
Yes, the Gypsy here.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.890
Sinful creature without a

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.790
And in the world spare for my bell ringer,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.490
the bishop has sent word that he is concerned as well.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.290
He might be,

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.590
this was a commissioned officer,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.490
she was trifle.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.690
I am aware of that.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.290
I don't like your tone.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.190
A decorated,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.690
Captain a liar,

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.390
a drunk and The Gambler.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.990
He is a sad loss.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.890
the bishop once this matter resolved,

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.090
the Lord Bishop asks,

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.590
whether you will find an answer archdeacon,

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.990
what answer shall I give him
