The plague after the novel by al their Cammy.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.000
A local church church. Hello. I would

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.040
describe what happened I was awed. Everyone agreed that what

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.010
happened shouldn't have happened here it was just like anywhere else you see

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.040
tourists for instance always said how open minded and friendly we were how all

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.960
the city was but then when

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.980
a few people die everyone thinks is the end of the world not.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.010
People expect the events of that spring or what they would later to be the 1st

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.970
signs of. Want to know how it all started. The doctor

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.960
the doctor was the one who wrote everything down.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.970
My name is Dr Rio and. On the morning of April 16th

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.020
I discovered

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.980
a dead rat in the middle of our landing and I was late for my 1st round

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.990
so at the time I paid the rat no attention pushing it aside and continuing down

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.960
the stairs on reaching the street however the thought occurred that this rat

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.990
had no right to be there and so I returned to the building in order to inform our

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.960
caretaker. Mr Michaud told me quite categorically that

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.950
there were no rats in his building then on the evening of the same day this was

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.990
still the 16th I returned home and I was looking for the keys to our apartment.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.020
And where are you when

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.020
a 2nd. Op out of the darkness on to the land it was

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.040
walking erratic Lee and the fur looked down. It stopped.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.020
It's and tried to regain its balance moved towards me.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.990
There was

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.040
a. Gaping it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.000
Don't mean. Person.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.030
Yes On the evening of the 60 when you saw coming.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.990
Did it make you think. It made me think about my wife.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.010
Bedroom. And why had you told her to do that because she was leaving for the clinic

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.950
at noon the next day she had been ill for nearly

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.030
a year at that point and she needed to prepare herself for the stress of the train

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.980
when I got upstairs I told her to sleep if she could I kissed her and she.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.970
Smiled. We all need to involve feeling.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.010
We continue yes yes. The next morning our carriage.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.040
Stopped me in the hallway Ah. Me that.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.980
His word had dumped 3 more dead. During the night

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.960
they must have been trapped by an amateur he said because these ones were caught in

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.020
blood. On my roans that morning I saw at least

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.960
a dozen rats that had been dumped out with people vegetable peelings runs complete

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.950
I was back home for 11 as planned and my wife was up and dressed she asks me what

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.960
all this business was with the rats and I said I didn't know it was odd but.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.030
I promised that when she came back home from the clinic everything would be

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.980
different at the station her train was on to.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.960
Her to look after her. Walking past he was carrying

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.040
a box full of dead.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.040
The 17th I had a visit in my surgery from

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.950
a young man that I had never met before apparently it was urgent.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.950
Yes. Send him in.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.950
Remember. I am

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.970
a journalist and one of the big nationals has commissioned me to do an article on

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.030
the living conditions amongst the Arab population here I mean some health

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:42.010
statistics do you so tell me have the people you are working for commissioned you

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.010
to write the truth. To your people would allow you to fail

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.010
a total condemnation of the current going to probably not but then

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.010
a total condemnation would be justified would it. No it probably wouldn't but you

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.990
are either reporting with restrictions are without and I would need to know that's

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.990
a very extreme language it is the language of somebody who has decided that

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.980
personally they are not going to participate in any further injustice or compromise

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.020
with regards to those particular anybody. Well sorry for disturbing you Dr Not at

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.980
all. I missed the round there yet surely the story just know it's all these dead

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:33.040
rats people keep saying round really well what can you tell me about that.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.020
Mining. I wasn't a journalist and I certainly wasn't

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.980
a doctor I suppose you might describe me as more of

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.980
a mom looker but I did keep this diary I had

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.950
a suite in one of the more presentable hotels in the town center at that point was

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:01.010
living there actually and coincidentally I was also quite often in Dr Rhea's own

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.020
building. For instance And I don't know when this was exactly it could have been

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:14.010
the 17th all the 80. Anyway I was coming down the stairs from visiting my

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:19.980
2 Spanish friends on the top. And the dog was standing out on the land

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.980
again I said even Dot is a funny business because there was

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.950
a rat dying right there at the dock to see Indy and one that is becoming

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:38.010
increasingly annoying. Always interesting to see something you've never seen

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:44.020
before. Ah I do hate it when they just fall over and bleed to death but.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:52.000
I think we should be clearing that up too Mr Michel. It was the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.970
$700.00 that was the evening of April 17th the 2nd Mr

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:05.040
Michel. Mr Michel ho he was

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.030
feeling I noticed him rubbing his throat but he said he'd be fine once the blasted

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:18.020
rocks had all gone. And I noted their own neighbors dustbin no overflowing

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:24.040
the tar seems to be hemorrhaging rats caffeine's and school playgrounds were

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.960
starting to close even the evening people picked up the story that week surely

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.950
people are entitled to ask what emergency measures are now in place in the unlikely

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:41.030
event that this situation continues. It is important to note that this all

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.010
happened in

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.980
a very few beans no wonder people will be will that it was the kind of bewilderment

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.030
you see when

00:08:48.030 --> 00:09:01.000
a perfectly healthy patient suddenly tests positive for something. The

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.020
doctor has to. I was

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:09.010
a journalist my only responsibility was to report what was happening what people

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:13.040
did or didn't do with that information was up to them.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:22.020
I remember Michelle telling me he was no experiencing being in his neck

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:29.030
in his armpits and growing and that he was having difficulty breathing and I told

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:36.010
him to stay indoors 29 received the 1st report from my wife's clinic

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:43.970
or proceeding safely on Saturday the 29th there was that phone call from an ex

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:50.970
patient of mine Mr Grand Mr Grand worked still works at the tone horn but he wasn't

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.000
calling me from there he was using the phone out on the landing in his building

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.950
telling me to come quickly because of only about hello who.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.990
Yes yes yes yes of course.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.990
Dear Dr you said an emergency is my neighbor Mr Carter has done something rather

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:25.960
silly I think I'm going down in time where is he Mr. In his bedroom Mr Qatada.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.980
The chair he'd used was stood on its side in the living. It's just as well the rope

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:40.960
gave Mr Carhart there is no damage to the vertebrae that I can feel. I mean all the

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.010
x.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:49.040
Rays and me well. Yes of course this will help. There

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.000
will be quite

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:58.000
a lot of bruising and I shall have to make sure that woman necessary. Don't

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.960
miss what I thought if you were to take it in joy I had to try again and the

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.020
autoworkers had been informed they might cite the doctor I was responsible it was

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.040
just

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:13.040
a moment. Really all right all right all right. We will leave

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:19.000
things as they are and I will come back and see you 2 more 3 days Mr Grant.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:29.960
Out on the landing and I remember. You if you knew him and you said

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:36.030
Not really but that you would stay with him anyway because sometimes

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.980
sometimes people just have to look after each other.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:53.010
And you looked at me you told me you'd go to patient actually I wanted to get

00:11:53.010 --> 00:12:00.010
home and write to my wife 29 continued rut no

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:07.010
mysteriously vanished Mr Michel confined to bed downstairs I called Dr

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:13.980
Richard he was our regional chief medical officer he reported yes he'd also Thien

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.000
a couple of cases of fever with enlarged lymph gland but nothing that he considered

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:25.040
normal. His exact words were Norman. That's

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.000
a tricky word Dr the. Then it p m

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.960
8 pm on the 29th.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.040
Phoned Michele's wife in

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.040
a state of extreme distress patient delirious 40 degree

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.990
extensive black lesions developing on flanks and. Attempted.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:03.020
But too painful. I would return the next day and they were to call

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:09.990
if necessary and then. The 30th

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.980
I received a 2nd report from my wife's clinic and I see

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:21.990
a route to the blue sky the whole tone few as if

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.040
a week has been lifted. There is

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:32.000
a smell of LHO was even. We still had no idea

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.030
if he knew

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.980
a deal. I

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:48.020
remember drifting in from the suburb and the sudden onset of

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:55.020
delirium the patient pressing themselves into the stretcher as if they wanted it to

00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:01.990
swallow them. And then. He died in the ambulance

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:08.980
cause of death suffocation. I think with the

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:15.950
1st cases there were mostly feelings of surprise you see it had never

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.030
occurred to people that they live somewhere where caretakers die of unidentified

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:27.020
diseases. But then when the people started to get it who weren't caretakers and

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:34.010
who didn't live in the poor parts of town that was when the real fear started and

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:40.040
when people are frightened or they start to think they think what he did.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.020
When the 1st of Mr Michel's neighbors was brought in lymph nodes opening up legs.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.970
I took samples and then called Dr Richard again immediately he told me in no

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:03.000
uncertain terms that no one he knew was suggesting isolation at this did that's

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.010
right sorry doctor and you have to remember that there was still nothing in the

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:14.960
press by the way of actual reliable information at this stage nothing correct and

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.970
as long as each doctor was only aware of 2 or 3 cases no one thought they had to do

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:26.960
anything but then people started to add them up which is why the next morning I

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.030
received this phone call from the office of Dr Kass Dale this time the head of

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:38.960
Public Health I was touring look Rio We all understand that on people this is

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.970
impossible everybody knows that threats like this were eradicated from our part of

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:49.960
the world years ago but come on doctor you know as well as

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:56.050
a do of this is somebody has to use the word. To use the

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:03.020
word so I did incredible but.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.980
I have always been playing and people always say. It won't happen.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:21.950
And even if it does. That would be stupid. And people are right

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:28.990
doesn't stop them from happening and yes it's not true I'm not sure to keep on

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.960
going to work to keep on making travel plans

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.990
a plague consuls the future plague shuts down travel makes opinion

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.030
redundant people think free. For.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:56.950
Yes thank you that's right yes my name is grand Joseph grand I was

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.970
working at the Town Hall as as you heard births marriages deaths you know

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:08.020
statistics always the same but then on May the 7th

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:15.040
I had to record 11 deaths in 48 hours which was new so

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:22.980
yes I called in on Dr Rhea at the surgery I felt I had to speak to somebody Izzy.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:31.960
Come in. Doctor Good morning I've brought you those new figures I mentioned to you

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:38.000
on the phone. Thank you Mr ground 0 is that neighbor of yours Mr Cottle and

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:43.950
I said he should come and apologize without trouble the other day but. No trouble

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:50.010
with the grant. And. Thank you for the Yes Look Dr

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.030
I've always believed we have

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:59.000
a duty to call things by their proper names 11 deaths in 48 hours

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:06.980
what is this I'm afraid I can't tell you Yes Well words are never easy and

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:13.970
I always wish I could learn to express that better myself yes. Yes Look tell Mr

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.970
Carhart I'll try and drop by when I can really and thank you again for the grand

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:27.030
if you'd excuse me. I can remember wondering when he gone if the

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.970
pig stood less of a chance with us because it was coming to

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:37.030
a place where we still had people working in local government cared enough about

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:43.990
words to try and banged the right ones. I knew that was

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:50.970
stupid. I had been informed in writing by Dr Katz del that

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:57.010
serum was being manufactured and would be available to order in the fullness of

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:03.010
Tang. And I was told that my senior medical colleagues were fully aware of the

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:09.980
current situation but didn't want to be seen jumping any gun. Proof

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.950
measures may be a lie but the official quarantine was still

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.020
a long way. And meanwhile.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.960
Home from work I remember being confronted by

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.040
a woman who had blood pouring from her growing.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.020
Right in the face.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.970
Yes that's right. It wasn't until the 1st week of May the newspapers finally

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:53.950
admits it up in

00:19:53.950 --> 00:20:00.030
a few cases of some unidentified. However they were sure they didn't amount to

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.040
anything disturbing

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:09.010
a few voluntary measures were announced. On May 9th the 1st

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:14.970
official figures were released from the town hall. Figures admitting to 16

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:20.960
fatalities in one day I remember watching stick around going home every evening

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.040
always carrying his briefcase I was working on

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:31.010
a letter actually to my wife and. They're always looking as if he was

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:36.000
trying to ski print something. Wrong corners all the time I'm

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.960
a 10th the list of $24.00 deaths now obviously

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:43.970
a few deaths people it's the end of.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.000
A bad man actually I'm

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.960
a 13th 38 Looking back maybe that was a very 1st hint of

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:03.020
a smile yes 38 in one day and at this point I said publicly that

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:08.980
voluntary measures were now completely insufficient and compulsory quarantining

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:14.000
should take immediate effect I was told that the plays of a new theorem or

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.980
a boat to be flown in but not when and then on May 14th on me the

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:26.960
14 the author already is finally gave way I suppose they finally got the official

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.990
communique read as follows. Declare

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:34.040
a state of plague. Clause in the town.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.030
Close to the gates several hours before they went public with the announcement and

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.020
there was no right of appeal so

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:49.990
a lot of people were trapped. I thought that was dreadful mothers and children

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:55.030
couples who had kissed each other goodbye for work just the day before they were so

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.950
sure they were going to see each other again using the word Goodbye was just

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:07.960
a formality there were such crowds that week in the office arguing asking for

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:14.950
favors you couldn't get people to realize the word exception just didn't mean

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:21.010
anything anymore there were in the words. I got through it by going for long walks

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.980
by imagining the sound of her ringing the doorbell just at our usual time. Making

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:33.990
the journey that run again in my imagination if an exile

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:41.970
in your own country oh really. And then when you are not to.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:50.000
The 5th day. Or mail services and all subject to cancellation

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:56.030
petrol is rationed there are cues that all the shops we commenting May 17th

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:03.010
302 feet are cases recorded 302 of course

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:10.040
statistics 302345 Mike Green Cross or

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.040
people said he was home. When they came to take him to the hospital do you know

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:24.010
what was in the man. And there was this other man in the tents and when he realised

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:30.980
he got symptoms he just threw himself on the nearest woman Afghani. Got

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.020
a. Honestly it was the world gone mad

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:42.010
$487.00. And like I say I found

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.020
I had to talk to someone. Anyone.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.020
Else. I thought I'd ring the breakdown of this week's figures before they're

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:02.990
released with the ground they're all there thank you. I see yes

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:11.000
can I ask Dr. How wishy excuse me the picture on your desk Oh yes

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.950
my wife she's being treated for

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.040
a long term condition abroad I suppose it's good she wasn't here when they closed

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:26.030
the town yes I can cure everything you know these days yes my wife was called John

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:33.960
but we both worked so hard that eventually we forgot to love one another I was

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:40.960
never able to exactly express myself you see on always has to begin again

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:46.000
I think one does with the ground I've been trying to write John

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.990
a letter I sit down every evening after work and yet I never see come

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:59.030
in I'm I'm sorry Mr Grand I ha I do understand Dr again

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.950
Water words that is

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:08.980
a word. Yes yes. Come in doctor I

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:15.030
want. Sorry I was just leaving We'll talk later Mr ground Good morning

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:23.010
yes can I help you I came once before. Remember the reporter Oh yes

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:29.020
living conditions amongst my neighbor Yes but actually that isn't why I've come I

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:29.040
need

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:36.030
a favor Yes. Right the thing is before I came here I met someone I managed

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.980
to let them know that I'm still Ok but obviously being confined here for the

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.980
duration was never part of my job description so I approached the town hall usually

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.960
my contacts said Obviously I'd agreed to be quarantined on the other side after

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.010
I've been let out but the answers come back this morning but they fully understand

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:58.950
that under the current circumstances I mean it's ridiculous it is this woman and I

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.950
were meant to be together is that to much to ask it is

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.000
a perfectly reasonable thing to ask we've only just met you see and it's going

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.040
really well so I wanted to ask if you could produce some sort of certificate

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.960
stating that I don't have the bloody thing I really think that could swing it you

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.040
are not thinking straight Firstly I don't know if you are free from infection

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.950
Secondly even if you were in the time between you leaving this office and you are

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.000
getting back to the tone hall you might not be and thirdly yes as

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.020
a difficult would be useless there are thousands of other people in exactly your

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:44.020
situation it is ridiculous I know but we have to get through this together

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:50.960
but I'm not from here as from No I am afraid you are everyone is do you have any

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.990
understanding how being torn apart like this actually feels look.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:04.960
I really hope you 2 will be reunited just as I hope everyone separated from their

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.980
loved ones in the abstract you talking as if this was some kind of reasonable

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:14.950
situation I am talking facts I agree they are not always reasonable I will get out

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:20.950
you know I'm sure you with but that can't be any of my business Oh it already is Dr

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.960
I came to you because people are saying you played quite

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.000
a significant role in getting the time quarantined and I thought you might want to

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.990
undo one small part of the hom you've done but evidently you don't. You don't

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.020
care enough people good morning.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.950
Abstract hearing

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:50.010
a young mother say to you Oh I do hope it's not this is funny fever people are

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:56.980
talking about abstract when she starts holing accounts. When

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:03.000
you see the pile of disinfected. Abstract when he left my office.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:09.950
Or went to visit somebody else Mr I think I watched him from

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:15.990
a window and noted the way he hurried even though the streets were empty and then

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:21.950
I went back to my desk. And started work again.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:31.970
Dr. The 14th the street so much quieter now.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.020
People no longer come out to watch the ambulances today I overheard

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:43.000
a woman saying at least when you see someone quarantine you can tell yourself it's

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.970
them that has it not. Such sordid struggles between the happiness of the

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:56.960
individual and the iron laws of the place. The 52 day

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.960
I went to the doctor to see about running a volunteer team. And b.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.950
That frontline is currently only have

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:10.030
a one in 3 chance of surviving asked what made me want to get involved the

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:16.030
answer came easily morality I send my morality.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.000
June the 16th assembling

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:25.960
a 1st team of volunteers took less than 24 hours.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:34.040
People say now that the volunteers will heroes. Wasn't just

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:41.010
a case of 2 and 2 equal in full. The we had an obligation to battle over

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:46.950
Didn't some people said nothing was any use that we should just get down on our

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:53.000
knees. No no. The disinfection

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.970
squads that victim transport change the ambulance drivers they were all for 20

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:05.010
years and then in the evenings my letter sometimes

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:11.000
a whole evening on just the one word you may

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:19.960
afterwards. In the evenings I look at her picture.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:26.970
In the evenings. I drank in the cafe by the railway station.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.990
I was making

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000
a fortune cigars alcohol cause I tried not to spread any thin I may not deliberately

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.980
is hardly my fault as

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:45.010
a plague was it I said to you Mr Ahmed I have some friends and. You know

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:51.960
cafe friends who work for an organization specializing in your sorts of case

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.980
Mr Armor man and. Man and I am. Glad

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:07.950
of course my friends do cigarettes and alcohol mostly and coming in but they do do

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:14.030
people occasionally going on and it costs about 29 or 10000

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:21.040
really. When are they taking bookings will 2 sympathetic guards might be on duty

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:26.030
next week Claude. Next week tell me.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.970
He turned up at the volunteers office late that same evening he'd been drinking of

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:40.950
course I'm scared I'm forgetting her mystery.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:49.020
Which is why I've got to do it. I've got to No excuses Mr Wrong there I'm peace

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:54.980
you're getting out really really at this point in our lives surely lying far too

00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:00.040
much of an effort shamed What are you going to be useful in one of our health teams

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.990
here I'm not

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.960
a coward you know I just happen to believe in living or dying for the thing you

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:13.030
love there and you should talk to the doctor about. The doctor hasn't

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:20.000
anybody to lose. You don't know know what. The

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.960
doctor has

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:27.960
a wife in the clinic hundreds of miles away and she was transferred

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:34.020
there 3 weeks before this all got properly started she's dying of

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:41.020
TB. Tory Mr

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:47.990
Truro I must go such sot it struggles between the happiness of the

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:52.030
individual and the laws of the plague.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:09.970
And I needed you to forgive me for the doctor real speaking Mr Marandi.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:17.990
Why do you want. You can go on and.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:25.950
Yes and miss the time Ruth team. Mr Romber if you don't mind it is not

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.960
a 4 o'clock in the morning good night.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:46.960
Made us tired him made us see things we never wanted to sing of course

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:52.980
you could try not looking Try saying this can't be happening but what's right in

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.970
front of your face does have

00:33:54.970 --> 00:34:00.020
a way of asserting itself there's not much use avoiding the subject of what really

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:00.980
happens to

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:07.950
a corpse when one day soon that corpse might belong to somebody you love at

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.980
1st that would just simple changes no church no family oh

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:19.000
a burial transports rooted to avoid the busy parts of town and then as the numbers

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.980
rose everything was done after dark. And finally no records no names

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:32.000
just be off. The smoke it made us

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.020
forget you see at the beginning of

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:42.030
a plea you remember very clearly what you've lost but.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.970
After

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:50.970
a while you lose her memory you remember the face but the bones have lost

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:56.980
their flesh that's how plague while. Everyone starts to say

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:04.010
isn't it time this was all over not really all bitterly

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:11.040
like they did in the beginning. Hopelessly it's not so much a question of of give

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.020
a hell. Give you

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:18.990
a way. Accepting. Accenting.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:28.980
Well all gust came and went thank God But in September and

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:34.970
October nothing happened to us but time missed the run there was no working

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:40.040
alongside me working every single hour I should say yes but he still met with me.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:49.950
With these money yes and every time I felt the shame of wanting

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:56.020
happiness while other people are dying still couldn't find the right words for my

00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:03.010
letter and then at the end of October and this was in the emergency unit actually

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:10.010
at the hospital. And you see the doctor and you

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:15.010
see Dr do the award rounds down the corridor and 2nd that aren't.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.970
They useless but they inspire confidence in others not the. Doctor why aren't you

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:31.040
at your quarantine unit in the school the 1st but of serum is ready this message

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:38.020
just came through for you. Go and find how right

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.010
you want to be here. That's right.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:52.990
These notes are from the end of October. The boy I chose for the serum trial was

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.040
8 years old the son of

00:36:55.050 --> 00:37:01.020
a judge as it happens when they brought the boy in I had made the mistake of asking

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:07.950
the Father if there was anything I could do to help. Yes he said you can see my

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:14.040
child hold him steady. 8 pm on the 1st evening

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:21.020
infection terminal administered maximum recommended. And Emanuel

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:27.950
missed the grand joined us during that night as well. Change you hit it.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:35.950
Right. There was no movement except for the characteristic tossing of the head

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:41.020
left right left. The boy's temperature was stable initially.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:54.010
Flexion of the. Involuntary spinal spasms Mr Bear all through

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:59.970
joined this point. We will have to wait.

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:04.000
As if you had

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:14.960
a child before we just hadn't had to watch it like this. Hunted

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:21.020
monitoring of the pulse I could at least fear I was doing something. He

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:27.000
kept on getting away. To. Try and.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.040
Get the blanket. Head shaking again.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.030
And then.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.010
I have to get.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.000
I don't. Suppose to write down.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:21.970
We need you to sign that one that one was innocent you know that

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.990
God. Sorry.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.970
Exhaustion makes one irrational you see what I hate.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.950
Death. Death and even though I hate them i

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:50.970
hate them and I feel complete refusal Dr no

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:58.020
peace I do not want to discuss this we are fighting and that's

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:04.020
all that counts we are working and enduring. And

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:11.030
fighting you know Shall you tell the parents or shall I.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:19.980
Think that. Changed us on I think seeing.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:25.040
Changed. Things. Changed.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.960
In November there were demonstrations everywhere and in the camps the quarantine

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:40.030
camps that everyone pretended they didn't know existed well well you see that's the

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:45.000
trouble with waiting waiting too long the policy is and the idea you might once

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.960
have had of

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:51.010
a future being different was when you see room which started to have some successes

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:55.000
but there were also new forms of infection so while

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:58.990
a time we made into Christmas well that Christmas was

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:05.000
a Christmas from hell. The shops. Nothing except the private

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:11.990
disgusting celebrations of the bridge. And then on December the

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.030
24th as the brand to turn up for work it was freezing out on the streets when the 3

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.980
of us finally found

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:27.030
a reason. He was just standing there staring into an empty shop

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:33.980
window. Oh thank God

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:38.980
there he is. Here you 2.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.990
Mr ground. 0 are you. Oh. Oh you know.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:57.980
In the end you get tired. You just want to see another human face

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:04.990
you want yes you want you halt to leap up like it used to people

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:10.970
well. Why not. Oh yeah.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:18.040
When I saw an old oh help me. Help me he's got the fever.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.980
Rather you take it on Mr time to get around him play

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.030
a little cough Come on Mr Brown crawl on the ground where to.

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:48.020
Put him on the bed from Maryland no blanket prohibition on Mr Grumpy

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.020
doctor. In the draw down there there's

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:59.010
a letter I want my wife to know how I feel you see but before he did rather. Well

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.040
I'm going to give you

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:06.950
a shot. If you run away the 2nd broke down looking at the ground and

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:14.000
do I need you to lie still for me. Calling

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:14.960
for

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:22.020
a little Mr Crewe. But there's only one sentence to read it to please. My

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:29.010
beautiful son. It is nearly Christmas and. I

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:34.030
know I know I know beautiful isn't the right word one should always call things by

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:40.960
the right and I. Don't have time. But it's.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:47.980
Not the right words to what he says wrong bear. Not the right road.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:55.950
Just starting with the ground no no no. Thank you.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:05.030
You know he probably survived the night will stay. You can get some

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:08.990
sleep you can check back you're in the thank you.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:18.970
But then then I 7 o'clock the next morning

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:26.010
Dr. Doctor at 7 o'clock the next morning his

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:32.970
temperature was. Normal Good morning. Listen.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:41.020
Paper in the drooled I. Want to start again I do want

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:47.010
understand I didn't understand and that lunchtime

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:53.950
a young woman who'd also had the new serum her temperature came down overnight as

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:57.970
well the morning remission lasted.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:07.990
Today is Chris smiles from that point on the figures

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:15.020
started going down in. Hope very deep

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:22.000
inside. And said anything in public but in private people

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.990
began talking about hope. It's not going to happen overnight

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:36.030
it's always easier for things to fall apart than to be put back together. Back to

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:39.980
Hell they were immediately no but.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:48.980
We were still under curfew but as soon as it became possible to hope.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:59.040
Over the situation can now be considered officially under control prophylactic

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.960
measures currently being inforced will be kept in place for another 4 calendar

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.990
weeks and then the gates will be opened.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:15.000
The something you have to keep in the bank it's something you have to keep in

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.990
reserve until you're really sure you can let it happen. So long as the

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:28.040
next news is good that was what I was thinking so long as the

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:35.020
next news from the clinic is good and be able to start again I

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:41.000
was thinking that I wasn't the same person as I used to be. Thinking.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:49.970
You really want to know. Your doctor wanted to barge

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:56.010
in without an appointment but let me ask you Do you really think it could

00:46:56.010 --> 00:47:01.990
stop just like that no warning no reason Mr Carter it's possible in other words it

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:07.020
might all start again tomorrow that's what you say or the decrease in cases could

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:13.040
accelerate tomorrow that's also possible the fall and if the gates open in 2 weeks'

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:19.990
time like this and then walked we all go back to normal life what's

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.000
that when it's being able to go out and see

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.010
a brand new movie you can understand people wanting things to go back to how they

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:34.960
were before showing I tell you what let's start again with nothing no past no

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.000
records and then if they come from

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.000
a Yes I just won't be there good luck Mr Potter Do you really mean

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.990
that oh as I said once to Mr Wrong back at this stage in our lives sincerity

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:58.950
is really the only option shall we shake hands no don't touch me.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:04.020
25th. The gates are finally open

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:12.040
a momentous day and night but am I ready to begin again I can only

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:17.970
say that there is always a moment in the night or day when you realize you are

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:24.970
a coward and that moment is the only thing I am really afraid of I

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:31.970
am suddenly very tired and that. That is the last thing

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.990
I have

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:37.970
a wrote in my diary I was tired and I forgot to inject myself with my issue of

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:44.040
serum that's all they were all there to look after me. When the time came.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.970
Perhaps it's nothing serious I have the temperature and the heading those are

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:58.040
symptoms of lots of things and yes I forgot I fought hard I

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:00.960
remember there was rain outside for

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:07.020
a while and that I slept but then in the early hours of the morning it all came

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:07.960
back with

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:15.990
a vengeance and I started spitting blood goodbye. Thank

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:22.040
you. You must have been very tired as well actually I was very calm

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:28.030
even when you got the news about your wife even when I got the news about my wife

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:35.030
when did it happen the morning you died January 27th I meant when did she

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:42.020
die. On the 19th apparently communications were terrible

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:49.030
that final week I'd been expecting it but they don't matter to

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:55.970
pain I was really there are ready but I didn't take much part in the

00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:02.010
celebrations when the gates were finally opened. As I'm sure you can imagine.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:10.990
I was out of station platform waiting for the very 1st train to arrive and she came

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:17.980
smashing into my chest before I'd even seen her. And I knew in that moment

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:24.980
that my lover was now absolute stranger. To morrow

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:32.050
everybody would have to go back to real life to the compromises. That one day

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:37.990
of celebration you saw people who would never normally have spoken to each other

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:44.970
together really together joint does that

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:52.010
death doesn't. Complete denial

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:59.030
everyone. Forgot the graves forgot the lie forgot the smell

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:06.950
forgot the fear. Everyone not everyone Mr Carhart

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:13.960
if you don't mind these are minute. 27th the very last day.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:20.950
I was walking Mr Grand back to his apartment and there was

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:27.000
a line of policemen right across the street. That I heard.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:35.040
This Mr Cutter. There were police in

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:40.980
every doorway they were firing back to keep him occupied. While.

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:46.000
There was

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:54.950
a dog in the street and he shot it down on its behind. And he shot it. He

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:58.950
shot. The dog blood made

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:02.040
a great block in the road. And then they brought him out.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.020
And you all know how we. Have.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:27.010
Twice. Now and. He fell over.

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:35.010
And the policeman really let. The crowd joining and we got him

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:40.030
dog and then you could hear the fifty's going into his. Group

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:50.000
2. What was happening. And the policeman said. There's

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:56.000
nothing to see. We looked away.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.990
The town got back. To. The doctor and I said goodbye.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:10.980
I finished my letter. Did you know that to call things by their proper names you

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:16.990
just have to cut out all the objectives and then I went back to work.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.030
That night there were fireworks fireworks.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.990
And it was then. With all that noise rising off around. And I

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.970
decided to write everything down. I decided to not being one of the people who

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:46.970
keep silent but to speak and bear witness. To make sure that there was at least

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:53.020
some memory of the violence is and injustice that had been done to people. And to

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:59.020
put on record as simply as I could what it is that you learn when you live through

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:05.990
a time of plague namely that there is more to and man or about people than there is

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:12.970
to despise or despair of. That's what I wrote there is more to admire

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:18.030
about one's fellow citizens than there is to despise or despair of No

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:20.960
of course it wasn't

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:26.950
a victory the doctor's not saying this is some kind of record of victory it is what

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:33.030
it is on account of some things that had to be done. Will all have to be done

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:37.030
again at some point none of us was trying to be

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:42.000
a saint you know. We were just refusing to submit.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:50.980
The feelings as I listen to the celebrations I thought Joy is

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:55.990
always under threat and I also thought about what the crowds were choosing to

00:54:55.990 --> 00:55:02.000
ignore and it's something anyone can look up if they want to which is that plague

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:08.980
never actually die. It never disappears it can lie dormant for

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:15.970
generations can bag its time in living rooms in basements in bed sheets

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:23.010
until one day or the misfortune of mankind are for

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:30.000
its instruction perhaps it wants more roses its wrath and sends them

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.990
forth to die in thongs on suspecting City thank you

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:38.980
thank you.
