1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,190
You see how he sits in that dirty dressing down.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,890
He's been sitting like that since 27 minutes past

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,290
one.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,390
I know that because I have a very expensive watch given

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,490
to me by one of my former patrons.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,890
Nothing.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,490
I say,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,390
provoke him.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,690
I'll be.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,690
Would you stick it in the prison guard before long?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,690
I always eat the other one.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,390
Have you seen him today?

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,390
He's getting better.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,690
I think he is.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,690
And the witch.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,090
What did she have to say,

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,790
for herself?

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,190
I talked to her of Dimitri's Escape.

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,590
She's agreed to help.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,390
She may have,

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,890
but meter will never do it.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,790
I have the name of the officer who's willing to be bribed.

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,290
What do you suppose?

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,590
America is like

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,390
I don't know.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,690
They have cities the size of Moscow saw,

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,990
quite civilized.

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,190
I always wanted to go to Italy all go then.

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,890
Wherever You Wish.

30
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,790
Do you know what I'm saying?

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,290
Meet you,

32
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,490
we're discussing your future.

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,190
Your Escape would allow her to come to Siberia with

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,390
me even if I marry her

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,690
Good good.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,090
Just better slow.

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,290
But you must swear always to look after my bruschetta

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,190
swear it.

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,290
Elects a few other bits where it in the name of all the

40
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,390
saints and Angels,

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,590
you will look after not me.

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,790
I'm not a humble man.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,290
I'm a violent,

44
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,590
angry fool.

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,690
If they beat me the water's there beat me if they raise

46
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,990
their hands to me.

47
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,190
I will not submit.

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,090
I will attack.

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,690
They will shoot me.

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,090
It will be better.

51
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,490
Sir cannot bear to think of how they will treat me and

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,290
perhaps they will spit at me.

53
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,590
Do you think so,

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,090
I couldn't do a torture.

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,390
Let them break me burn me,

56
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,490
thank me.

57
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,290
But if they say things to me,

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,390
Well, they laugh at me Katerina ivanovna knows all

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,690
the details of advanced plant.

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,190
No, no,

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,790
I will not Escape.

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,390
Abandon my cruel fate,

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,190
all I have.

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,190
All I own.

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,190
No, that's the word.

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,690
He says,

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,990
that's the answer to everything.

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,090
That's what it comes to all his protestations.

69
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,290
The vows he made to me,

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,490
no.

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,490
Do You Love Me Above everything?

72
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,790
No, not more than Pride.

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,290
Will you be with me?

74
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,790
No.

75
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,990
Will you sacrifice your conceived for me?

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,490
Know, will you abandon this mad delusion of suffering?

77
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,090
No.

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,990
Will you bring one small ray of light back into the

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,590
world?

80
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,290
No.

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,990
Will you break my heart with pleasure?

82
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,990
He won't Escape.

83
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,490
He wants to make a martyr of himself.

84
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,090
People judged me,

85
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,990
people, a rapper,

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,990
the fat old men,

87
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,990
Feed how the murder might Inspire their own Sons,

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,590
not kill.

89
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,590
My father.

90
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,190
I know that we are guilty men.

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,290
What does it matter that the details around Diamond

92
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,090
are wrong?

93
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,390
But it is not you alone,

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,290
meteor who will suffer the blow,

95
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,590
think of your gross gun.

96
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,590
We can think also of Katerina ivanovna Christ cursor,

97
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,190
Only If You Escape,

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,290
will she ever be able to forgive herself?

99
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,690
Otherwise she will carry that burden to the Grave.

100
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,490
Happiness, depends on you Yvonne's happiness.

101
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,090
Mine.

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,490
Yeah, well,

103
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,490
I suppose even the prison Warden would have had the

104
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,290
man has to wait to be invited in,

105
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,490
but not you.

106
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,590
I will kneel here.

107
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,590
Dmitri fyodorovitch on this ground until you say

108
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,490
you have forgiven me I hear,

109
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,290
I knew you would come.

110
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,990
Did you,

111
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,490
did you ask her to come?

112
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,790
Tell her alyosha!

113
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,590
Tell her that.

114
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,390
I feel like I don't speak the beginning of this story.

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,090
The Elder knelt before Dimitri in token that his time

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,990
of suffering was about to begin.

117
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,990
And do you remember that meet you?

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,090
Now, this woman is kneeling,

119
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,290
before you to say that,

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,590
your time of suffering is over,

121
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,990
you forgive me,

122
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,990
and I forgive you on my life,

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,890
you will be a wound in my soul and I will be a wound in

124
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,790
yours Garth.

125
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,990
Now if you are listening,

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,590
restrain, you must be quiet.

127
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,990
Crochet.

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,190
Okay.

129
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,190
Must I why?

130
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,590
Because I asked you to this woman and I must speak to

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,290
one another,

132
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,590
where they all lies,

133
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,790
then the words we spoke.

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,990
I worshipped you.

135
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,190
I wanted you.

136
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,390
I told you again.

137
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,790
And again,

138
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,290
I loved you.

139
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,190
What did those words mean?

140
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,790
Dimitri.

141
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,490
I am the one who betrayed you in the end?

142
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,290
Yes, you are betrayal.

143
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,390
Let us not talk of that.

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,290
What is worse?

145
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,890
I think.

146
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,490
Is how much we disappointed?

147
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,090
One another,

148
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,090
I disappointed you,

149
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,590
of course.

150
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,490
But beautiful Cathy.

151
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,490
Are you disappointed me as well?

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,890
Disappointed with you?

153
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,490
How?

154
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,590
How dare you say I disappointed?

155
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,590
You is not the time for this.

156
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,090
Session, you forgive one another that is enough to

157
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,090
meet you if you're rich.

158
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,190
When I spoke in the court,

159
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,590
when I gave evidence against you,

160
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,990
I believed you guilty,

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,790
as long as I kept speaking,

162
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,090
I was convinced but the minute I stopped.

163
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,490
I knew,

164
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,290
how did you know,

165
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,590
innocent?

166
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,690
Do you believe me?

167
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,590
Everything hangs on that?

168
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,590
I don't care.

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,890
What is said before,

170
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,390
what you believe before?

171
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,990
Now at this moment,

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,290
you must answer me Katerina ivanovna.

173
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,990
Do you believe me innocent of the murder of my father?

174
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,790
I believe you before God on your hopes of Salvation.

175
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,690
Yes.

176
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,790
I agree to America.

177
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,890
Do you because Missy he throws you a few kind words.

178
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,990
That's absolute n'.

179
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,190
All right.

180
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,390
Wish can show your mettle biting and fighting forbidden.

181
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,590
We have to be practical.

182
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,290
We need money for the Escape we needed today or tomorrow.

183
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,190
Will you give it to us?

184
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,790
I'm to rescue you as well,

185
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,090
am I?

186
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,090
That is part of the price.

187
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,590
I must pay.

188
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,390
It seems the gently Katarina.

189
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,490
She can speak as she likes.

190
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,190
As long as she gives us the man who talked to her in that

191
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,490
way.

192
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,690
Shakers, born much.

193
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,590
And I have not

194
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,390
He sent out Yoshida beg for help,

195
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,190
and I will give it.

196
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,290
So now the ocean I didn't beg for help.

197
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,590
Where did my own accord catcher,

198
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:04,990
of course,

199
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,190
before you swore you would go to Siberia to suffer

200
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,190
for your sins but everyone changes their mind.

201
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,890
We are all human.

202
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,890
He's thinking of us have be of grushenka loved you

203
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,490
Katia and your conscience and he's thinking of a barn

204
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,690
of how he will feel.

205
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,390
If he were to hear that,

206
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,990
his brother was in Siberia.

207
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,090
He's wondering if he could survive that blow

208
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,990
I have decided in his name in that lofty Souls name

209
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,590
and for his sake I will assist you what are you trying

210
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,390
to do?

211
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,790
You want to make me angry which to provoke me at a casting

212
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,890
this gift in your teeth?

213
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,290
Would that be that last and most pleasurable Twist

214
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,090
of the knife?

215
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,490
Yes.

216
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,090
That is what I'm trying to do.

217
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,990
Why are you sure what demon is in my heart?

218
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,090
I should be ashamed of myself.

219
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,390
Well, Katya,

220
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,390
you don't mind.

221
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,590
If I call you catch her.

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,290
We are almost family speak if you want my opinion.

223
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,390
I blame us both about equally for the sorry past.

224
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,190
We brought our men to me more than you probably.

225
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,090
I admit that.

226
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,090
Oh no,

227
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,190
right?

228
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,890
And yet,

229
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,990
it's true.

230
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,490
One day,

231
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,990
one night when we are in America and I am drunk.

232
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,190
I will say all that to you.

233
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,090
I will remember your words and repeat them to you.

234
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,390
Tell you that lie,

235
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,890
that exact lie that you are to blame for it all and I

236
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,990
will rejoice to see you cry.

237
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,690
Yes.

238
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:34,990
Yes.

239
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,690
I will never cease to be what I am a carom has all that

240
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,890
greedy, impetuous Beast,

241
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,890
a cockroach,

242
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,790
listen grishka,

243
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,990
everything that has happened to me.

244
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,790
I brought upon myself.

245
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,290
It was not you either of you that made this man.

246
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,090
It was not that times.

247
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,190
Is the turmoil of our times.

248
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,090
It made me.

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,790
I made myself this monster.

250
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,990
Remember, I went to the house that night.

251
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,390
Remember the weapon I had in my hand.

252
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,290
It was God's love that saved me.

253
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,590
Isn't that true alyosha?

254
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,790
Yes, I believe that.

255
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,890
I believe he is willing to save us.

256
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,990
Yes, I hope that's true.

257
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,290
I have nothing more to say.

258
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,690
We forgive each other.

259
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,790
It is enough.

260
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,690
I don't forgive you never,

261
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,590
I don't forgive myself.

262
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,590
I will never see you again Dimitri.

263
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,190
Our farewell.

264
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,690
She enjoyed that scene,

265
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,290
didn't she?

266
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,090
Run after her alyosha.

267
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,590
Make sure of her her money.

268
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,090
Trust her,

269
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,490
don't worry until tomorrow.

270
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,590
I'll meet you at the end of the month,

271
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,790
you'll be in America America.

272
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,290
We will go to America,

273
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,390
gross gotta there will be times when we would give

274
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,590
our souls to be.

275
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,190
Even in Siberia,

276
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,490
so long as we were home in Russia,

277
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,990
I would hate America,

278
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,090
they're foreign jabber.

279
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,390
How will we live over there on the edge of the world?

280
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,790
I'll be back with news tomorrow.

281
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,990
Why did I talk of Russia?

282
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,090
It's not losing Russia.

283
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,090
That will break my heart very soon.

284
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,590
I will say goodbye to him.

285
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,790
I will say goodbye to alyosha and never see him again.

286
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,190
I would never see the man,

287
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,290
he will become.

288
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,290
How is that possible grishka?

289
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,390
Wind in a graveyard,

290
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,990
you never feel anywhere else,

291
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,090
the cold cruel wind and ship or shivering body,

292
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,690
know how model it is is that smudgy cost gray,

293
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,890
just grave?

294
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,390
It's where I buried him and I get myself in being a suicide.

295
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,390
His mother put a cross in his hands.

296
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,190
Well that wasn't enough for some people.

297
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,590
Superstitious isn't the people still believe such

298
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,890
things?

299
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,190
No.

300
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,990
Oh yes.

301
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,090
It's true.

302
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,090
It's a thin line between us and Them.

303
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,290
The dead ones he was Restless in life so he won't be

304
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,290
different dead.

305
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,490
Put the rope in his coffin to remind him.

306
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,390
Don't get no nothing.

307
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,790
I'll give the boy a drop.

308
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,890
Bit of bread and a handful of salt.

309
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,790
The bread is his

310
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,190
Will you eat some salt for him?

311
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,590
Yes.

312
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,890
Smells your cough.

313
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,290
He was my Father's,

314
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,690
son.

315
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,590
I thought you were going to ask me something else about

316
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,390
Dimitri.

317
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,290
Are you angry that I gave evidence against him?

318
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,190
That's him.

319
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,590
Best of You.

320
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,090
You know,

321
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,390
the Devon is very real.

322
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,490
Brain fever,

323
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,190
they say.

324
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,990
But as a man answers,

325
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,290
Really live.

326
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,990
You think?

327
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,290
I think he can be persuaded to do that.

328
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,190
Immense magic of no harm.

329
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,890
It's our comfort but he meant him.

330
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,490
No good.

331
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,190
I daresay.

332
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,590
I would like to thank you for gave it did say,

333
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,290
you would

334
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,290
You didn't believe Dimitri guilty of the murder,

335
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,090
not really,

336
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,690
and yet you gave evidence against him.

337
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,390
I forgive you for that in all our names.

338
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,090
I am the name of the karamazov same.

339
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,590
Well, smerdyakov was my son,

340
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,590
he deserves something.

341
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,790
Someone had to suffer.

342
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,790
Alyosha, what will become of you?

343
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,690
I will leave this town this place.

344
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,690
Perhaps, perhaps I will go to Moscow.

345
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,990
I don't know.

346
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,090
Hmm, another handful of salt and then we're done.

347
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,690
Take the Vodka.

348
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,790
You'll need it.

349
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,190
Now, you're getting a taste for it.

350
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,790
I see.

351
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,490
Thank you.

352
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,190
You are not.

353
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,590
The boy you were no.

354
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,190
Have you been to speak with your mother?

355
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,290
I wish I could remember.

356
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,590
sometimes, when I go to sleep,

357
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,590
I did be my Mafia,

358
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,290

359
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,590

360
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,890

361
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,690
Give your mother my respects.

362
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,190
I will

363
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,790

364
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,090

366
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,590
I don't know what flowers.

367
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,290
Do you like mother?

368
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,590
If you liked any.

369
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,490
I think you may have had hay fever.

370
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,890
Someone told me that.

371
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,790
So I'll take a little of some educause bread and Scatter

372
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,790
It On Your Grave.

373
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,190
The birds will come and I'll imagine that somewhere.

374
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,390
You hear them singing.

375
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,090
I've come to say farewell,

376
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,690
My mama,

377
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,190
did I call you that?

378
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,090
I've come to say goodbye.

379
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,890
When I think of this town in the future,

380
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,290
I'd like to remember this place.

381
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,290
Your Grave.

382
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,390
Yvonne will be well,

383
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,490
he would have gained his health and most importantly

384
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,390
is courage.

385
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,290
You'll need to courage,

386
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,490
if he's to marry Kat you and yet,

387
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,390
God is good,

388
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,990
I hope.

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,590
As for meat,

390
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,690
yeah, he's not your son,

391
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,690
but I think you must have loved him.

392
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,190
He too has a woman,

393
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,590
a good woman.

394
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,390
I assure you.

395
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,290
She is a good woman despite certain certain things

396
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,790
in their past things.

397
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,790
I can't say to you.

398
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,790
You smile.

399
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,590
You think I'm such a boy still?

400
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,390
I have no one and that is curious because I would like

401
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,190
to love and be loved it somehow.

402
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,490
I'm not fit for it.

403
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,490
My mom.

404
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,690
If you were here to cancel me,

405
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,590
what would you say?

406
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,390
I can't imagine.

407
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,890
You're crying.

408
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,890
Don't cry.

409
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,290
The Blessed dead and not supposed to cry and yet even

410
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,990
in heaven,

411
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,190
I imagine you weeping.

412
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,190
How cruel my father was to you bet his grave beside

413
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,590
you between you and me just mother I know yet there

414
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,290
old man.

415
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,090
You're listening to me,

416
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,690
smirking.

417
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,290
She is nice dry bone,

418
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,090
while you,

419
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,390
of course,

420
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,390
are a mess of corruption.

421
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,790
Rotting, how you must enjoy that.

422
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,290
Still if you'd not died,

423
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,090
if we had not murdered you what might have happened,

424
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,990
what monsters?

425
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,990
Might we have become,

426
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,390
huh?

427
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,390
The brothers,

428
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,490
kind of mass off.

429
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,890
I might have become a saint a saint in the eyes of the

430
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,090
world and an affront to God.

431
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,690
Poor God.

432
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,790
I wish I could hear your voice.

433
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,090
You would laugh at me and ask for Brandy.

434
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,790
Old man.

435
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,790
You never really became an old man.

436
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,090
Don't be hurt.

437
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,590
My mom,

438
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,590
did I think of him that I'm always thinking of him?

439
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,590
You are not a karamazov,

440
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,890
you're not one of us.

441
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,390
And I don't say that to wound you

442
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,890
It should make you happy.

443
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,990
Listen to The Birds.

444
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,290
Don't listen to me.

445
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,090
I will go and find an unknown life and live it every

446
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,790
minute.

447
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,890
And at times,

448
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,590
if I fear myself,

449
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,290
if I fear my greedy Restless soul,

450
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,290
don't blame me.

451
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,790
Don't be angry with me.

452
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,190
Bless me.

453
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,490
Bless me both of you.

454
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,890
And the name of the merciful.

455
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,190
Let me go.

456
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,790
