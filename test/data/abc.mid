WEBVTT

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.140
Wake up, wake up. He was dreaming,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.390
twitching and muttering

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.840
Back at the end of the 1950s. So during the wall,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.300
um, my mother was there on the day.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.290
The soldiers came for her and she told me to try and be kind.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.590
Then I was trapped.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.710
It's inside the paperweight, Cherrington, sodomy,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.640
encased in glass suffocated, and fixed, unable to move

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.670
Crushed against the piece of pink coral. And from inside,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.550
I can make out a distorted image. Me as a boy,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.580
standing outside the Chestnut tree cafe pairing in it's something.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.500
Okay.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.100
My mother knew exactly the cold course world. The party planned for us all

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.490
Last words have kept me here. What about our love?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.740
Tell me about the cafe.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.570
Oh,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.160
it's where party men who'd been denounced went before they disappeared for good.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.470
I watch them through the window,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.170
staring and crying.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.690
It's off post 18. We should get dressed soon and go and see a Brian.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.320
What was that only challenge?

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.500
I think you ought to check

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.190
where's the charington is that you?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.970
Yes, it's very, don't worry. They haven't called us yet.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.070
And I told her to come back and tidy up a big   Mr.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.940
Smith, but don't worry. I'm sure I'll soon. Get bold and take myself off

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.570
Dream about my mother all the time now.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.120
Hmm.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.970
I did something that was very wrong.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.980
What happened?

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.670
My father had been taken away and it was just myself, my mother and sister.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.990
And she always seemed unwell and clung to my mother,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.070
like a baby monkey.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.990
I stole the food out of her hand.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.250
I stood there watching my mother, put her arm around my little sister.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.460
And that gesture told me my sister was dying,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.180
Cute and accrue. And if they aren't naturally,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.050
then the party teaches it to them. I don't want any bloody children.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.420
The party tries every turn to tell us that feelings,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.670
impulses and not worth anything.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.010
They want us to think everything is pitiful because everything vanishes.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.840
So why bother?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.380
And of course that's why they take people often perfectly obedient,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.610
good party members.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.510
There's no point in relationships because that person can be snatched away and

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.510
they know people need something to believe in. So they give us the traitor,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.510
Goldstein and the war and Mongol face troops who would pull the skin off our

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.550
backs for fun. A few weeks ago,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.650
I walked past the place where a rocket bomb had landed and there was a severed

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.570
hand lying on the pavement and I kicked it into the gutter.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.220
Like it was a rotten cabbage.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.780
We're barely human anymore.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.330
Has it occurred to you that the best thing would be to simply walk out of here

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.590
and never see each other again?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.090
I have thought about it, but I'm not going to.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.750
Yeah, we've been lucky, but it can't last much longer.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.150
If I confess they'll shoot you. And if I don't confess,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.740
they'll shoot you just the same.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.270
We shall be utterly without power of any kind.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.110
What matters is that we mustn't let them stop us loving each other.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.270
That would be the real betrayal. We must stay human.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.280
Even if it can't do us any good,

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.720
We can do that. We won't let them inside us.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.600
No. Perhaps a Brian will save us.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.960
Let's get dressed and go to see him.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.520
It was run five comas,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.420
seven approved food-wise stope suggestion, contained items,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.300
six double plus ridiculous verging crime things,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.050
canceled store and proceed, construction wise,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.030
getting plus full estimates, machinery, overheads, stope, and message.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.080
You can turn it off. We have that privilege. I had expected you to come alone.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.340
This is Julia. We are lovers. And we share the same belief.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.550
Hmm. Well then

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.930
shall I say it or will you,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.060
Are you sure that thing is really turned off? Yes. Everything is turned off.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.810
We are alone. We've come here because

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.040
Go ahead.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.100
Come here. Because we believe there is some kind of conspiracy,

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.100
some kind of secret organization working against the party and that you are

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.740
involved in it. We want to join it and work for it.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.820
We are enemies of the party. We are also love us.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.280
And as I am still married adulterous,

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.000
we have decided to put ourselves at your mercy.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.920
Martin is one of them.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.690
Gosh, that sit at the table. Martin, will you join us?

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.570
Certainly,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.360
although I shall have to reply to some messages that have just arrived from your

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.900
office at delay would be difficult to explain Martin.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.600
And I preserve the established codes for the sake of appearance.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.310
Although the brotherhood is democratic. Please sit down.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.420
It's called wine. No doubt. You will have read about it in books.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.610
Not much of it gets to the outer party.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.880
I'm afraid a toast to our leader,

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.910
Emmanuel Goldstein.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.800
Then there is such a person has Goldstein. Yes,

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.740
there is such a person and he is alive. Whereabouts I do not know.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.150
And the conspiracy, the organization, the brotherhood, we call it.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.230
You will never learn much more about the brotherhood than it exists and that you

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.380
belong to it. I'll come back to that. Presently. It is unwise.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.620
Even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for more than

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.500
half an hour, you would not to have come here together.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.490
It has made you conspicuous as there is no lawful reason for you to have done.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.130
So you will have to leave separately.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.950
We have about 20 minutes.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.600
I should have to ask you some questions in order to judge how serious you are,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.580
we're capable of antiquity. Are you prepared to give your lives? Yes.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.380
Yes. You are prepared to commit murder. Yes. To commit acts of sabotage,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.310
which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people. Yes.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.880
To betray your country to foreign powers. Yes.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.770
If it would serve our interests to throw sulfuric acid into a child's face,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.080
would you be prepared to do that? Yes. Yes.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.760
Are you prepared to surrender your identity and live the rest of your life as a

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.720
dock worker or a waiter much as Martin here has done? Yes.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.730
Are you prepared to commit suicide if and when we order you to do so? Yes.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.300
Yes.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:41.100
Are you prepared the two of you to separate and never see one another again? No.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.700
No. You did well to tell me it's necessary for us to know everything.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.590
Julia, do you understand that if he survives,

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.650
it may be as a different person. His face has movements, the shape of his hands,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.850
the color of his hair,

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.590
even his voice might be changed and you yourself might have to be changed beyond

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.260
recognition by one of our surgeons, Martins,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.270
eyelids have been cut to Western him. Sometimes we even amputate and limb

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:14.650
Good.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.880
It's settled. Then you better go back to the pantry. Martin,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.860
I shall switch on in 15 minutes. Please take a good look at their faces.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.120
You will be seeing them again. I may not

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.040
Goodbye. Well done.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.390
You must understand that you will be fighting in the dark.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.170
You will receive orders and you will obey them without knowing why I shall send

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.690
you a book that will teach you the true nature of the society we live in.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.990
Your contacts will change from time to time.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.780
As the old ones are arrested and killed.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.290
I am your first contact and we will continue communication.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.860
As long as we are able, I will give you orders through Martin.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.940
Whose role is to protect me from suspicion, by sacrificing himself.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.030
But we must assume you and I will be caught.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.370
Eventually when they catch you,

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.810
you will not be able to betray more than a dozen people.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.310
It sounds terribly lonely. It has to be.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.950
How should we know if we're making any difference?

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.310
You will get no comradeship and no encouragement,

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.360
but we may have hoped anything. No, you shall not have hope.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.780
We are. The dead

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:47.050
Feels like falling forward into a dumped grave. You must leave first comrade.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.260
How do you stand the loneliness?

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.180
Keep going, look out for chances to pass the news that resistance exists.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.720
Let's finish our wine to the confusion of the thought police to the death of big

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.730
brother, to humanity,

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.810
to the future, to the past.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.910
Indeed the past is more important to the past.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.180
Okay?

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.990
I presume you have a hiding place. Otherwise. How could you talk to each other?

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:27.160
An old junk shop run by an elderly fellow called Cherrington. Very good.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.070
Goodbye.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.670
Julia. It's likely we won't see each other. Face-to-face again.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.640
The boy Winston.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.380
He needs to stay for half an hour.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.840
Goodbye. See you at the show. Goodbye, sir. Please

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.470
Take one of those tablets to suck. You mustn't be caught smelling of wine.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.130
Goodbye,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.680
Cherrington. Hey, that's right.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.450
We'll have to arrange somewhere new. You can't establish habits.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.450
Now Goldstein's book.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.820
Do you carry a briefcase to work? Yes. Every day like regulation, black,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.500
two straps. All right. One day.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:23.680
Quite soon you will receive an instruction at work for a new editing task.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.280
And the note will contain a misspelled word on the following day.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:33.380
You will go to work without your briefcase. At some point in the street,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.920
a man will touch you on the arm and say, I think you've dropped your briefcase.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.630
The one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein's book.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.630
It will also contain an instruction describing where you should leave it.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.810
14 days later for us to collect. Thank you.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.520
It's what is it exciting? I suppose

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.040
I haven't thought of it like that for a long time, perhaps too long.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.190
Listen, although you will receive instructions from me,

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.520
I shall not acknowledge you. When we pass at the ministry of truth,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.650
my messages will come through others. So shall we actually talk again?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.610
Sadly,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.570
I think that is inevitable in the place where there is no darkness.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.070
What? It's a phrase my mother used.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.450
It's just come back to me. I think she was right. Yes.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.470
In the place where there is no darkness.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:35.710
Uh,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.730
is the anything you want to ask before you leave?

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.540
Yes, I have actually it's silly.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.700
Do you know an old rhyme that begins oranges and lemons say the bells of some

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:54.080
Clemens. You owe me three. Farthings say the bells of St. Martins.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:59.150
When will you pay me? Say the bells of old Bailey.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.550
When I grow rich, say the bells of shore ditch,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.860
you do know it. I used to know a lot of things that aren't much used to me. Now.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.750
I'm afraid. It's time for you to go.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.950
Shall we meet really? I'm sure of it.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.630
What's the mess up. Nothing's the matter. I've got a surprise for you.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:50.390
What do you think? You look wonderful.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.270
Beautiful, Mr. Children's and found the dress for me.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.620
He used to belong to his wife and there was no books for the makeup still in it.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.510
Don't cry. My darling. This is my treat for you.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.370
I'm doing this for you. For both of us.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.740
I'm going to do it whenever we meet.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.100
Take it off now slowly, please.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.530
Oh, you look wonderful. You're painted face.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.470
It's the washerwoman and next door's yard. As if she's singing.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.700
I have stolen

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:03.060
  with the smiles and the cross though.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.080
Toys, my heart strings.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.270
Do you think the book is safe?

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.040
I don't expect Mr. Cherrington will come in and poke around.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.190
I can't imagine him falling under the bed. Lifting floor boards.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.150
You think it's really worth our lives? Yes, I do.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.070
Would you like to read it? I'd like to have sex.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.200
If what Brian says is true, the man you have so many times left to us,

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.180
but the smiles and the tears across the years,

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.610
they twist my heart strings yet.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.620
I bet she would rather have sex. She can't read. Now.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.030
They're not taught. And don't know,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.870
Should I have a special voice like priests?

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.200
I don't think you need a special voice.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.600
The splitting up of the world into three.

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:17.490
Great superstates was begun in the middle of the 20th century.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.900
By the land grabs that followed the world. War OCR.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.840
Hernia is founded on the United States,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.340
acquisition of Britain and much of its post Imperial Commonwealth.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.360
I remember to be kind. I remember to be kind.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.570
You owe me 10 shillings,

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.870
say the pills of St. Helens.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.480
When will you pay me,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.630
say   or

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.720
Able to

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:55.720
Take a decisive turn as peace is not in the interest of the political classes.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.310
Julia. Julia, are you awake?

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.910
Do you remember the thrush that signed tours that first day at the edge of the

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.000
ward, he wasn't singing to us.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.560
He was singing to please himself. Not even that.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.640
He was just singing the bird, sing the promo, sing

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.640
the party. Doesn't sing.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.390
We are the dead. We are the dead.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.780
Oh, the dash

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.320
was behind the picture. It was behind some climate days.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.300
Get out of the bed,

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.180
put your coats on, put your hands behind your heads.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.480
Step back to back.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.130
They can see us. We can see you. Well,

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.260
the house is surrounded. The house is surrounded.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.100
The charting to make up. You too. I'm so sorry. You might as well cycle.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.580
Oh, and by the way, it's here comes a candle to light you to bed.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.400
It comes a chopper to chop off your head.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.520
That's it. You make a movie and tell you that I can get your help. I smashed

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.190
no one told you to do that. The paperweight wasn't useful. I Oh my goodness.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.280
Sorry, please.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.230
And put the little bit of coral on the mantelpiece. Mr. Cherrington.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:55.450
I offered you the chance to say goodbye. You chose not to take it.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.890
That moment has passed. Keep quiet now. And yes, you're right.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.550
Although you would have been in the company of my con previously,

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.790
you won't have known about it. This is indeed.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.150
The first time you have knowingly been in the presence of an office,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.260
out of the thought, please

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.140
Did you

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.180


00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.330
Garrick. Okay.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:36.340
That one   six Oh seven,

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.970
nine Smith w take your hands out of your pockets in the cells.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.000
Tell it to F off, go on teller. Gordon Smith.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.580
Tell her Yangon, get said nothing on a camp. He's catching himself.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.660
So he should be how it might even look as they gave me a load of that.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.830
All right, once you get worse than us, we don't care.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.600
I never cared. I keep us in high chocks is the white. When they're ready,

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.460
triggers the gear to Boston. I don't know why. That's what I say. Do him back.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.020
Give him back. What about our, I he's the one who's bought you in there?

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.360
No, not your soap. He'll give you a, a clap with a stick. Actually is tricky.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.780
That's a bone in your elbow makes you feel hot.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.760
The actual suit. Why should I be afraid?

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.680
What will they do? You spoke up. This might be a phone. Good. And I'll say,

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.890
sorry. They'll be nice. They'll let me go. They'll put bloody wise on ya.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.940
And he was screaming the place down. Yeah, you got to go Smith.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.610
He gave you a little dad. You go see Merrick. That's your girl. Love you.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.280
Cause she love us. You know? It was a no, we started

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:55.900
 .

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.190
Yes.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:13.250
Possums. Huh?

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.200
What are you in for?

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.790
There is one. He want offense. Isn't that committed to it.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.110
You don't think they'll shoot me to your check.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.520
  called to help, but

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.740
I'm sure the fair hearing. Oh,

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.010
administrative love. I trust them completely on that school.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.160
I know all about my good record. Brainy of course, but keen

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.680
chatline, he could make himself pretty useful in the labor camp. Are you guilty?

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.550
Of course I'm guilty. I think he thought he would arrest an innocent man. Dude,

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:10.300
I felt crime is a dreadful things and it started talking to him asleep down with

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.880
big brother. I said it over and over again.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:17.950
He'd seen so I'm glad they got me before I went any further. Thank you. Okay.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.170
I have to say thank you for saving me before. It was too late.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.730
Who denounced you having a smile? My little daughter.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.520
She was listening at the keyhole.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.890
She cared what I was saying and dipped off to the patrols. The very next day.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.900
I'm grateful to her. It shows up right

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.510
and left to excuse me all about. It's not as if I've got a choice.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.180
I can't help it. It's it's the fifth, the white

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.600
six Oh seven nine Smith. I'm probably all face your eyes. Your nose

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.100
broke. Can't get rid of it.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.270
That's in Seattle.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.160
And that was a thought Boston was coming to Michigan. Yeah,

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.780
but bloody pike. I partisan. So where are we going?

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.710
If I have to come over to the LTS. Thank then. I'll bloody. Well,

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.630
stick it in your habits or one on one of course. Yeah.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.740
I'm going to get this out of disgust, but please.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.590
Hey, I warned you

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.490
cry. Well, I want, I want her

00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.090
fed you. You want me to give it away? I've got a wife and two children.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.160


00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.780
why one Oh one.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.110
It shouldn't be all three touching

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.220
somebody must've gone wrong with the tiny screen.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.060
So you didn't even want to check

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.560
in one for one.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.690
Wait, what did you say?

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.950
His dental plate. It's on the floor there.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.970
Oh dear. That's broken. You'll have to do with it.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:47.580
Anything more to say? No, I didn't think so.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.470
They got you too. I'm afraid.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.970
They got me a long time ago. Winston,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.880
please stop diluting yourself.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.770
You just wanted to believe it was all possible. Didn't you?

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.430
Yes.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.150
If I could save by doubling

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.710
The pain, you will inflict on me that I do it. Would you ready

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:54.980
his elbow? Please

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.370


00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.960
Remember

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.850
everything explodes into yellow light inconceivable.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.200
Conceivable that one blow could cause such pain.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:18.700
Of course.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:23.700
The thing about pain is you can only push one thing that you'd stop in the face

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:31.030
of paid. There are no heroes, Winston

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:37.170
 .

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.130
Do you know where you are? I don't understand.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.970
I told you when we drank wine together, that if we ever met again,

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.530
it would be here in this place of light. Whether it's never darkness,

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.190
we put you to sleep and we moved you. Ah,

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.700
you've seen it. What? This is the machine.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.990
You're now connected to it by the copper plate set into the surface of the

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.640
bench. And that's why you're in your pants please.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.450
No, I don't want you to start up. Please

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:30.010
open your eyes. And look, there are two controls.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.420
This style determines the amount of electricity delivered by the copper plates.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.210
This switch turns the current on and off.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.320
I just gave you 40% of the total is obviously a hundred percent.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.190
I am your interrogator now.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.030
And if you tell me any lies or attempt to prevaricate pretend you're stupid.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:57.220
And I know you to be, then you will instantly cry out in pain.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.360
My back, yes, I know you have, for many years suffered with back pain.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:06.010
It's a result of poor diet that your vertebrae or decay and your right to worry

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.620
because the current forces your muscles into spasm and there is a danger.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.240
You may harm yourself.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.780
Perhaps even paralyze yourself.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:21.250
If you are difficult or obstinate, why are you doing this?

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.240
You don't need to. I'm taking trouble with you. Winston,

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.840
you are mentally ill.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.530
You are unable to remember real things.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.360
And instead substitute them with deranged images of people and events that do

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.720
not exist. Let's try an example.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:45.690
Who is Oceania currently at war with? When I was arrested,

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.100
we were at war with the station.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:52.100
He stays shot God and Oceania has always been at war with East Asia.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.340
Has it not remember that? One week before I was arrested,

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:02.360
we were not at war with East Asia at all. We were in Alliance with them.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:04.100
The war was against Eurasia.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.180
That war had lasted for the previous four years before. Well enough,

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.870
let's have another example. Now,

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.160
some years ago you had a very serious delusion.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.610
I read it in the diary you wrote in your vellum notebook,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.760
you saw three ex party members called Jones,

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.390
Aronson and Rutherford in the Chestnut tree cafe. The shocked you,

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.660
because you believed you had once held in your hand,

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:34.960
a photograph cut from a newspaper that proved their innocence because they

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.560
weren't anywhere near the site of their crime.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:45.320
And this is that very photo. How did you find it?

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.560
That doesn't matter because it's going into the memory.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.980
Ashes. Dust

00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:00.320
Did exist. It does exist. It exists in my memory. I remember it.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.600
You remember it? I do not remember it.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.300
What does the party say about control of the past?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.060
Who controls the past controls?

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:18.050
The future who controls the present controls the past? Yes.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.900
Who controls the present controls the past?

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:26.060
Is it your opinion that the past has a real existence?

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.420
I'm trying to have a serious conversation with you.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.730
You may not be much of a metaphysician,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.910
but at least do me the courtesy of trying to ask the question again.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.050
Does the past exist concretely in space? No.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:47.330
Then where does the past exist? If at all in records,

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.640
it is written down in records and inhuman memories,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.490
memories very well. Then we,

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.870
the party control all the records. And so it follows.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.580
We can control the memories too, but you can't stop people remembering things.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:09.230
It's involuntary. You have not controlled my memory country.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.850
You have not controlled your own memory in our time here right now,

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:19.120
the only sane mind that exists is the mind of the party.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.840
What the party holds to be.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:25.790
The truth is the truth to become sane.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.950
I must destroy my memory. Yeah.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.950
You wrote in your diary that freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.570
makes four. Yes I did. How many fingers am I holding up?

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:43.510
Winston full. And if the party says it is not four but five,

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.630
then how many full?

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.380
That was 55%.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.880
How many fingers Winston full

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.440
your back? How many fingers? Winston for

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.520
70%. How many fingers Winston? Oh, stop it.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.370
Stop it like this. You know, there are four.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.350
How many fingers?

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.130
No Winston. That's no use.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.950
You still think that all four,

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.690
how many fingers please? Five. Four.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:51.880
And you like always stopping stop the pain. You are a slow learner. Winston.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.480
Sometimes they are Winston. Sometimes they are five.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.150
Sometimes they are three.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.640
Oh DME.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.410
It isn't easy to become saying

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.370
I'm putting the dial up to 75.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:16.240
I confess I'm concerned about your back.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.890
Don't do it again. Then you go to ask me the question.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.030
How many fingers are there? Winston, I would see five. If I could.

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.090
I'm trying to see five of which you wish to achieve.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:32.260
Persuading me that you see five or really seeing them really to see them then

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.100
for your second, go to skip 75% and go straight to 19.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:41.100


00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.400
Do you know where you are? Winston in the ministry of love.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:09.240
Do you know how long you've been here? I think it's months.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:10.950
And why do you imagine that?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.950
We bring people here to make them confess and know to make them sane.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.170
What will you do?

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:24.170
Then we share out either metaphorically or actually turn you into gas and pull

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.000
you into the stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.340
not a memory in a living brain.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.910
You will never have existed in that case.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:38.770
Since

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.150
You intend to destroy me utterly,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:46.670
why go to all the trouble of interrogating me or trying to make me sane?

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.650
Our rule must be absolute

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.520
And wait, Mr. Rays, any resistance,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.460
we cannot tolerate dissent anywhere in the world. However,

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.610
secret and powerless it may be. Or you have to understand.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.060
We are bringing human social evolution to an absolute stop.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.020
We shall not be one of the many civilizations that have risen and fallen

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.910
throughout history. We are permanent.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.210
We will make your brain perfect. Before we blow it out of your head,

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.120
we must squeeze you empty.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.750
Then fill you with ourselves.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:26.650
I would have preferred

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.010
No we don't.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:32.010
We always prefer to change the whole person rather than take cheap shortcuts.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.700
But you are a hard work. Winston,

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:43.530
these will modify you taking away a little part of you,

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.110
but perhaps making you happier or rather content with what is happening.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.340
This won't hurt. It will actually make you feel better. Now.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.490
Lie down.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.400
No,

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.860
Just bite on this piece of leather. Will you

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.510


00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.670
Are you back Winston? Yes.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.290
Don't worry. Perhaps it feels as if everything is almost the same,

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.520
but some part of it has been taken away. You can't quite tell which,

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.470
but you feel its absence. Perhaps

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:47.350
what country is Oceania at war with? I don't remember.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.210
Oceania is at war with East Asia. Do you remember that now? Yes.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.370
Oceania has always been at war with East Asia. Do you remember that?

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:01.750
Yes, I am holding up my hand.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:06.610
There are five fingers. Do you see five fingers? Yes I do.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.220
My hand is not deformed. Is it? No.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.800
Today it just happens to have five fingers and a thumb.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.130
Yeah. Yes.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.490
And so you can see what I've been discussing with you all these weeks is in fact

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.400
possible. I can,

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:32.320
I enjoy talking to you Winston now,

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:35.520
before we bring today's session to a close, I'm going to let you me,

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.820
whatever questions you like. Really?

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.610
Any question? I like anything.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.090
What have you done with Julia sheep

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.550
Betrayed you Winston immediately.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.790
And unreservedly I've seldom seen anyone come over to us so quickly.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.190
All her rebelliousness, her dirty maintenance,

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.870
everything has been burned out of it. It was up. Perfect.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.700
Good version.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.530
When you said she betrayed me, what do you mean?

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:09.650
Next question. Did you talk to her? Next question?

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:13.340
Does big brother exist?

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:17.060
Of course the party exists.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.310
So big brother exists,

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:24.140
Exist in the same way I exist. You do not exist. I exist.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.870
I was born and I shall die.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.470
I occupy a particular point in space

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:34.340
Is of no importance. He exists. Does the brother

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.110
Goldstein's auntie in sock, brotherhood exists shall

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:43.160
Never know. Even if we let you live until you're 19, you shall never know

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.230
Goldstein does not exist.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:50.270
And if you will always intent upon arresting me and curing me,

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.900
yes.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.900
Why go to all the trouble of writing and printing Goldstein's book with all its

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:57.670
thousands of words.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.940
I actually wrote it. That is to say,

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.910
I collaborated on writing it. As you know,

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.150
we do not produce books as individuals anymore and its purpose.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:13.240
It's supposed credible program for undermining in sock and it's fantasy about

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.120
proletarian revolution.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.270
That's all intended to give you hope for a secret accumulation of knowledge,

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.890
for an enlightenment,

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.430
for the illumination of the people in their eventual overthrow of the party.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.730
It aims to give hope and draw moths to its flame.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:38.000
Before the party, there was nothing outside, man.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.750
There is nothing. What about the star? Small crucibles of fire,

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.300
a few kilometers above. They don't deserve our attention.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.810
They have them are only of interest for their function as a navigation,

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:53.090
But even to navigate by them. We must know that motions, distances behaviors,

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:57.140
how can human beings become so involved with their workings?

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.490
And at the same time,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.810
think of the universe as a meaningless jumble of marks in the sky,

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.870
Your thought crimes are directly related to your refusal to accept the sublime

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.510
release provided by double thing,

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.590
which allows a human being to seek to know only that which is useful and nothing

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:22.100
more ignorance is necessary. It's wonderful, powerful.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.420
It is the bulwark of double thing. And behind it all sits violence.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:31.160
Violence is the key. If you want a picture of the future,

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:36.820
imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever,

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:42.790
sooner or later, the population will see you for what you are.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.620
And they will tell you to pieces.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.340
By changing the language we narrow thought within a few years,

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.790
the population will be unable even to consider change.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:53.800
They literally won't have a word for it.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:59.890
What's in room one Oh one.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.600
You know what's in room one Oh one Winston.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.240
Everyone knows what's in room one Oh one.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.740
I have not betrayed Julio. No, that's perfectly true.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.740
You have not betrayed Julia. When will I be shot?

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.080
It might be a long time. You want a difficult case,

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:29.340
but don't give up hope everyone is cured sooner or later

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.120
in the end we shout shoot you.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.320
Oh, you look much better, faster,

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:53.970
stronger incarceration is doing you. Good. Um,

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:58.830
how's the, uh, the ulcer on your leg better and uh, your teeth,

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:02.760
uh, they said they pulled them all out and given you dentures. Yes,

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.720
they feel good. Thank you. And thank you for the slate and the chore. Yeah.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.450
As you've been writing, could I have paper? No.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:11.670
The slate can be wiped once you filled it.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.540
That's good because it has no memory paper. On the other hand, I understand.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:20.160
I hear you've been sleeping quite well.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.910
Will there be a time when the light will be turned off? Not in here. I'm afraid.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.970
What do you dream about a golden country?

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:34.920
Enormous sunlit ruins with my mother, with Julia,

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:39.210
with you. What do we get up to in your dreams?

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:43.410
We talk of peaceful things. Is there something you want to say to me

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.330
I've missed you and

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:55.100
I have accepted everything go on the past is alterable but the past has never

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.780
been altered. OCR. Nia has always been at war with East Asia,

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:05.190
Johns Aaronson and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes with which they were

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:05.940
charged.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:09.750
There never was a photograph that disprove their guilt about how do you feel?

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:14.790
I hardly know why I ever rebelled. If I said to you that by a simple act of,

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.330
well, I could float off this floor and up into the air, like a soap bubble.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.710
Would you agree? That is true. Of course, Tommy Moore, Winston.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:28.200
It's obvious that if I say I can float in the air,

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.340
then I can. Yes.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.350
If you think you can float off the floor, if I think I see you do it,

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.670
then the thing happens.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.920
I see what's the matter you are.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:47.360
Assuming there is still a real world where I didn't float off the floor at all.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:48.620
A world of so-called facts.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.830
You imply there is a space between believing what you are told to believe and

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.240
knowing it actually isn't true. I don't think that's a problem.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:04.340
Don't you know, cause sometimes with you, I feel like I'm teaching a child.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:08.270
You're an intelligent man. Why doesn't your mind work more? Definitely.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.350
Everyone's saying understands.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.820
They can believe conflicting things simultaneously because conflicting things

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.280
can simultaneously be true. Double think wisdom,

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.630
double think we invented it so that people can remain sane.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.210
As part of this one's mind has to learn the ability to stop dangerous thoughts.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:33.230
Instinctively banned them. That's what crime stopped means.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.340
But I suppose we're getting there.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.400
We must both be patient.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.270
I'm sorry. I am trying

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.110
Well, tell me more about your dreams.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:51.010
Are there ever anxieties in them?

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:55.240
I think about Julia. Of course you do, but don't worry. That will stop.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.580
Don't really?

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:00.700
Why not?

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.390
Because I'm convinced that somewhere. She is suffering,

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.150
that she is alive and needs my help.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:15.270
Do you remember the texture of her skin? In my dreams?

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.270
She has an overwhelming presence. More real than waking life.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.140
Get up.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.790
Look at my face. Winston, you have been deceiving me.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:51.370
Stand up straight and look me in the face.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.170
You are improving intellectually. There's very little wrong with you.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:00.520
Tell me Winston and remember no lies. You know,

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:02.170
I can tell when you're lying,

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:07.920
tell me what are your true feelings towards big brother?

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:15.070
I hate him. You hate him. Good.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.560
You were very weak and I was afraid. We might kill you.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.240
You want a stronger now strong enough for what's necessary.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.870
The time has come for you to take the last.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.800
You must love big brother. It is not enough to obey him.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.430
You must love him. God's

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.640
take him to room one Oh one

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:47.620


00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.780
And you asked what room one Oh one was,

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:04.400
there was no need for me to explain because you already knew perfectly well.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.010
Everyone knows what room one Oh one is.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.180
They know from the nature of the title and from the phrasing,

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:16.180
the way it's spoken room one Oh one is the worst thing in the world.

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:23.260
When you were a child and we took your mother and your sister and you came back

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.330
to that flat, you didn't know what to do. You were there.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.420
I believe for at least a fortnight. That's what your file says.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.670
A fortnight alone and starving and you fell asleep.

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:37.010
And when they found you,

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:42.380
the rats had nibbled your ears and your fingers. Do you remember that?

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:47.000
Now you're making it up. What do you think about rats?

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.460
I hate them.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.650
I stay away from them, which is difficult in London,

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.950
where they're certainly more numerous than people. None of this is necessary.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.090
What do you want me to do?

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.100
Sometimes pain is not enough.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:06.130
Sometimes we must subject a person to something so horrible that they cannot

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.500
resist and will surrender by instinct.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:16.270
This cage surrounds your head and can be secured around the neck.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:25.790
There is, as you can see an oblong box attached opposite your face.

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:30.620
It has two sliding doors in it. These can allow a creature,

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:36.490
a spider or a snake or whatever to progress steadily towards your face.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.590
As the doors slide open,

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.560
it gets closer until finally.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:47.710
Well

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.980
You understand the rest. I'm not afraid of anything like that.

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.350
I don't mind creatures nurse.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.750
Would you please,

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.790
Please eat fully. Want any use. Now are you,

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:15.350
this is a last effort to save you from insanity Winston,

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:19.580
a last effort at curing you. If the animals do get to your face,

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:23.210
it will be because we have failed and there would be no point in keeping you

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.560
alive any longer.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.060
In

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.100
Some parts of the proletarian quarter,

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:34.810
women did not leave a baby alone in a room for more than a few minutes.

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.490
Rats are carnivorous and voracious.

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.470
When confident or angry

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.740
I have pressed the first lever.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:52.450
There is not only one door between the rats and the whole face.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.220
They will first attack those pots. They can easily bite extremities.

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:01.930
Your nostril is eyelids lips.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:05.980
Then they will work into the soft parts of your mouth and cheeks.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.680
Although it's policy to us,

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:14.830
the rats will not be deterred by the smell of your promise.

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:18.550
They are forages too, and they will excite them all. The more Winston,

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.470
Julia,

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:27.540
Your hand is on the final lever. Now how smelled you

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.120
are ready for you?

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:35.120


00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:56.700
welcome to the Chestnut tree cafe gin.

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:04.980
Would you like essence of clubs in it? It's a speciality.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.870
You haven't tried it.

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:23.870
Can I sit?

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:28.680
I will do anyway.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:35.790
I saw you through the window.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.810
I just want to say something in case we run into each other again,

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.300
chess, are you playing

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:56.940
myself? Listen,

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:02.280
I want to be clear. You're not to come near me.

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:07.320
I betrayed you. I betrayed you too.

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:13.200
Sometimes they threatened you with something that you can't stand up to.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.530
Can't even think about letting them do to you.

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.290
And then you say don't do it to me, do it to someone else,

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.160
do it to him.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.800
And I said that because they helped me understand how selfish you really are,

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.750
how you only cared about yourself all along. If he cared about me,

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.010
then you went up. Let any of it happen.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.110
All you care about is yourself.

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:40.900
And after they've made you realize,

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:46.530
then you can't feel the same about that other person you anymore.

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.800
Anyway, I have to get to the cheapest station.

00:53:57.170 --> 00:54:01.360
What's that? What? You've written?

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:03.670
Something with the gin, with your finger on the table.

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:09.400
Hello? Look for yourself.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.000
Two plus two equals

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:21.310
what, what does it equal?

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.790
I don't know. Do you, I don't understand.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.460
It's good to see you must do it again.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:40.000
I have to go goodbye.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.300
Goodbye

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.680
three. We like to again

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:10.720
be spread thing to us.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:11.740
No three

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:20.770
tests in 1984 by George.
