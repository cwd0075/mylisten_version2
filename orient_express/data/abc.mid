WEBVTT

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.500
 What's happened?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 Why we stopped it's nothing serious,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 but myself it's more mechanical fault.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.600
 It is being attended to we always about 40 miles from

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.300
 my laptop.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.900
 Who is the likely to be much of a delay who can fill they're

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.600
 doing all they can but is it going to make us late?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.300
 I trust not myself.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.500
 I have to change trains in Istanbul if there's a delay

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.600
 I shall miss the connection don't you understand?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.900
 It's absolutely vital that I catch the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.400
 The Orient Express we present John Moffitt as Hercule

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.000
 Poirot and Andre Moran is Monsieur book in Agatha.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.100
 Christie's murder on the Orient Express.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.400
 You have a room reserved for me.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.900
 I believe what maims her they're killing Pablo.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 A room with a bath that is correct.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.400
 This is the first time you've stayed at the hotel Takata.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.300
 It is the first time I have stayed in Istanbul something.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.400
 I have always dreamed of and since I have a few days

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.100
 to spare.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.500
 I thought I would break my journey from Damascus and

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.400
 pray that Doris for a few days Santa Sophia the ancient

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.600
 walls of the city.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.600
 There is a telegram here for you,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.300
 Monsieur Poirot.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.100
 Thank you.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.900
 I fear I must ask you to cancel my room.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.000
 I am required urgently back in London Santos of here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 We'll have to wait for another occasion at what time

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 does the Orient Express leave at 9 o'clock.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.100
 Will you see if you can get me a compartment on the career

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.800
 coach, there should be no difficulty at this time

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.200
 of year Monsieur Poirot trains are invariably empty

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.700
 are certain quite sir.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 I will see.

 You're booking straight away.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.100
 You're very kind.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.100
 I shall take a little refreshment in the bar.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.200
 My dear Monsieur Poirot kiss your please wash your

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.800
 balls.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.700
 What are you doing in Istanbul?

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.100
 Unfortunately, I am about to leave it but it is very

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.100
 good to see you.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.500
 Mr.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.000
 Booth you are here in your professional capacity.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.900
 I had hoped to be here as a tourist.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.100
 I have been attending to a little matter in Syria for

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.400
 the French army and you are returning home search.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.900
 It seems as my fate.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.000
 I leave by the Orient Express,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.200
 but that is Splendid.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.900
 So do I

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.400
 At least I go as far as lose iron,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.000
 it will be a real pleasure to travel in your company.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.500
 Queen queen has all the luggage been brought down.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.000
 Yes.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.300
 Mr.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.100

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.200
 It's time we were gone.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.900
 What a repellent looking man.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.800
 Just another American Tourist.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.800
 My friend that man is not another anything.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.100
 He's like a wild animal.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.400
 He looks perfectly respectable to me maybe so but

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.800
 I cannot rid myself of the impression of an almost

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.700
 tangible.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.400
 Evil Monsieur Poirot.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.300
 I'm extremely sorry but there is not one first-class

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.700
 sleeping berths to be hard on the ýstanbul Calais

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.300
 coach.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.400
 It is fully booked at this time of year impossible,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.300
 but do not worry my friend.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.800
 I'm not a director of the company divide only for nothing.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.200
 I shall find a compartment.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.600
 For you on the simpler now and never here.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.200
 No mystery book it is quite impossible.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.200
 I'm sorry,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.100
 but every compartment is taken.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.600
 It is incredible.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.300
 We sure what is happening.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.500
 Is it some kind of convention a partner normalcy book?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.500
 They are all ordinary passengers.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.900
 It just happens that many people have chosen to travel

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.600
 tonight.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.100
 Well add Belgrade they will be the Sleep Coast from

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.500
 Athens that we don't reach Belgrade until tomorrow

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.000
 evening.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.100
 What is my fun to do tonight?

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 Is there no second-class berth

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.700
 There is one but it is a lady's purse and there is already

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.300
 a woman in the compartment a lady's maid.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.300
 She is a German how very awkward have all the passengers

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.100
 arrived I believe so.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.800
 No, there is a gentleman in number 7 a second class.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.700
 He has not yet come but the train leaves in four minutes.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.500
 He's an English man.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.500
 Mr.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.400
 Harris if his could have is he certainly will not come?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.000
 He will be like mrs.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.600
 Harris the friend of Sarah camp in the novel by chickens.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.100
 She did not exist put mr.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.000
 Burroughs Luggage in number 7 if this mr.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.100
 Harris arrives,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.900
 we will tell him that he's too late that births can

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.500
 only be held on till five minutes before departure.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.100
 We will find him a birth that belgae understood understood

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.100
 mystery book if the gentleman would be so good as to

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.800
 follow me.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.300
 I will take him to compartment number seven.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.900
 Is this your luggage Monsieur?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.500
 Thank you.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.000
 And thank you.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.800
 Miss you boo.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.800
 It is the end compartment that one of us,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.200
 you can apply American Standards out here.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.100
 It's just natural for the folks to be alone today.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.800
 Excuse me mother in my country is just the opposite

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.300
 something to do with the time,

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.100
 which I think I don't matter and I said to him you call

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.400
 it at making a sale.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.700
 I saw the 22 in one morning a senior here is the compartment.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.400
 Excuse me.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.200
 I think you've made a mistake.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.600
 Mr.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.000
 Harris, perhaps no.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.600
 No, my name is McQueen,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.200
 but I thought this compartment was booked this year

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.900
 Harris has not arrived and there is no other birth

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.600
 understand bull Calais coach.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.600
 The gentleman has to come in here.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.000
 Oh, I see if you will allow me to put your luggage on

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.300
 the requisite off.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.200
 Thank you.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.500
 Yours is the up.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.900
 perverseness in the train starts in one minute

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.500
 Do I really must have quite a pull with this company?

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.900
 I've never seen a conductor put a passengers luggage

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.800
 up before if you'd rather have the Lord birth,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.400
 sir.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.800
 I mean it might be easier for you.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.600
 And I don't know much we'd be no trouble please it won't

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.700
 inconvenience me in the slightest.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.400
 Then I accept after Road.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.500
 It will be for one night only at Belgrade.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.700
 I shall look at nothing Belle gray.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.100
 No you see I

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.900
 I didn't see you at breakfast more share.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.800
 I trust you slept well.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.700
 I always sleep when I'm trains hard.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.100
 This is a really excellent lunch.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.800
 Masoom book.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.500
 You keep a very high standard.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.200
 It is the Premier training Europe.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.800
 What else would you expect of us?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.100
 I only hope your passengers appreciated.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.000
 There are a very curious selection if I had the

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.800
 And of a bezeq only he could do this little scene Justice

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.900
 quite an idea.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.000
 It has not been the only thing and yet what a wonderful

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.300
 novel.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.000
 It would make all around us some people of all nationalities

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.400
 of classes and religious for three days in these people

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.400
 strangers to one another or brought together,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.300
 they sleep and eat on the one truth that cannot get

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.400
 away from one another just look at them moving think

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.700
 there's three men at the table.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.800
 They're thrown together by chance and yet already

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.000
 did.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.300
 Seem to have a something in common in my country.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.800
 We never do things about her.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.000
 So if we want the something we got for it just the same

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.500
 way that if you're going to do anything hit it right

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.300
 on the head it will come here and he turned into looks

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.700
 like a bandit from the Abruzzi and of very large American

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.800
 in a varied now to see who might perhaps be a commercial

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.900
 traveler, but the fastidious leader Englishmen

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.900
 who is with them looks as if he wishes he were at another

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.000
 table as far as I am.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.900
 I love true thickness is a much underestimated virtually

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.800
 State rather superiors servant and what do you make

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.400
 of the astonishingly ugly old lady in the Sable coat?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:50.900
 Yes, ma'am.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.100
 You will be good enough to place in my compartment

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.900
 above the mineral water in the large glass of orange

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.500
 juice certainly Madam and at dinner tonight.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.900
 You will arrange that I shall have chicken cooked.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.200
 Without Sosa's also some boiled fish.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.200
 Of course Madam.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.000
 I will see that she looks as if she would be more at home

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.400
 at the court of Catherine the Great and what po you

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.600
 are not far all you know,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.300
 that is the prince's Dragon.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.400
 Laughs she's extremely wealthy.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.100
 I've heard of a quite a personality now take the that

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.900
 woman over there the American lady with all those

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.100
 rings on her finger.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.600
 My daughter told me to take a book of food tickets and

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.800
 you'll have no trouble.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.700
 No trouble at all.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.900
 Not much in the way of aristocracy there unless it

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.600
 is the aristocracy of money.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.800
 So it seems they have to have a 10% if he has not stopped

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.100
 talking since she sat down at the table.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.300
 It is a mineral water Evian or visual weight is because

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.500
 they must serve as the water of each country each country

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.400
 were traveling through and as for that doubt is gonna

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.300
 name him lady.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.200
 Does she not look to you exactly like

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.400
 She poured on are you are not kind Monsieur Baroque.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.600
 Now, who is that?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.700
 Mysterious looking woman who sits with them and who

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.100
 doesn't speak a word quite a beauty in their way,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.100
 but the certainly not an innocent abroad like the

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.400
 start American lady over there.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.300
 I think I can Enlighten you my friend.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.100
 She is an English governess traveling home from Baghdad.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.000
 She and the tour lean military looking gentleman

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.200
 at the next table who is pointedly trying to give the

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200
 impression that he does not.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.600
 Not know her we're traveling together on the torus

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.600
 Express which I bought it at a level.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.200
 They went through a very pretty comedy for my benefit

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.300
 pretending not to know one another very reserved

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.000
 very English and then when the train stopped that

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.800
 Kanye they took a walk along the platform.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.600
 I overheard them just beneath the window of my compartment.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.500
 I wish to have a new world out of this business Mary.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.000
 It's no good talking about it.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.900
 Larry Larry.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:15.200
 I don't know not now when it's over when it's all behind

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.600
 us then and then they walked away curious.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.000
 Is it not I he was quite intrigued.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.200
 Do you always eavesdrop of romantic encounters my

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.600
 friend?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.700
 I was not eavesdropping.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.800
 I just happened to overhear it now.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.700
 Who else every the German ladies maid with whom you

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.300
 declined to share a compartment?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.400
 I cannot say I blame you.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.100
 She's exceedingly play and that very elegant couple

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.100
 over in the corner.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.700
 So perfectly coming through I scarcely think that

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.100
 the week in Paris will really give us time.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.300
 But surely if you promised Frances that we would be

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.000
 at Chevron.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.200
 Fourteenth's very handsome cover from his clothes.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.500
 He looks as if he ought to be English,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.200
 but I am certain they will not be at all pulled out if

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.800
 we arrived a day or two later.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.700
 No, no,

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.400
 certainly not English.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.400
 I would like a little time to consider my winter wardrobe

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.400
 Budapest is always at least six months behind the

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.100
 times very pretty and very chic issue not according

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.500
 to Michelle's list.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.400
 They are Hungarian the count and Countess underneath.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.000
 She's quite Charming.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.200
 No, but something is worrying,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.500
 huh?

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.300
 Why don't you stop playing the detective follows?

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:34.600
 I can never stop and I never play as you put it as for

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.700
 the other diners.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.300
 We already know.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:36.600
 Mr.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.800

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.200
 his employer your wild animal who we saw due to the

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.800
 barn.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
 What is his name?

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.500

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.500

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:13.900
 Thank you.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.900

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.500
 Mr.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.300
 Ratchett.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.300
 I believe that I have the pleasure of speaking to monsieur

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.900
 Hercule Poirot is that so you have been correctly

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.100
 informed decision my country we come to the point

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:33.700
 quickly.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.300
 I want you to take on a job for me.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:36.600
 Mr.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.200
 Poirot.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.800
 Mike can't tell is extremely limited nowadays.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.100
 Mr.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.400
 Ratchett.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.200
 I take on a very few cases.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.200
 I did not imagine it would be otherwise,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.000
 but I am talking big money.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.500
 Mr.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.900
 Poirot very big money.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.200
 What is it that you wish me to do for you?

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.500
 Let me put it this way.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.800
 I am a rich man.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.700
 I'm a very rich man and Rich Man inevitably to have

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.400
 enemies.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.900
 I have an enemy.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.600
 just the one

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.700
 What exactly do you mean by that?

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.600
 I you say that man in your position have enemies generally

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.800
 there are more than one enemy or anyways,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.700
 what does it matter?

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.200
 I'm only concerned about my safety.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.000
 My life has been threatened not once but several times,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.300
 mr.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.000
 Poirot.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.500
 I'm the kind of man that reckons he can take care of

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.700
 himself, which is why you carry a small automatic

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.100
 in your inside pocket.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.600
 I can see nothing much escapes you but there is no point

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600
 in not making a short.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.700
 It's doubly sure that is why I want you to be my extra

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.300
 cover.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.500
 You want me to be your buddy God.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.200
 I want you to find out whether threats are coming from

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.100
 you are the man for my money.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.400
 Mr.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.300
 Poirot and I do mean money.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.000
 You can write your own check.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.900
 I regret mr.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.200
 Ratchett that I cannot oblige you why the hell not

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.500
 I told you the sky is the limit in understand.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.800
 Mr.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.400
 Ratchett.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.800
 I have been very fortunate in my profession.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.700
 I have made myself enough money to satisfy both my

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.800
 needs and my Caprices I take now only such cases at

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.800
 interests me.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.900
 You've got quite a nerve Poirot what is wrong with

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.000
 my proposition if you will forgive

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.600
 Give me for being personal.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.600
 I do not like your face mr.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.300
 Ratchett.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.700
 I would not stand about here.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.500
 My friend.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.300
 It is bitterly cool.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.500
 I had hoped to get a little glimpse of velcade Walltown

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.100
 is much like another viewed from a railway station

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.500
 and it is snowing very heavily,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.800
 and they said that they have seen nothing like it for

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.500
 years.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.100
 I only hope that we're not held up.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.200
 I'm not happy about it.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.500
 I can tell you but let's get back into the train.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.500
 It is due to leave there shortly.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.200
 I have moved the gentleman's location to your compartment

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.900

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.100
 Thank you Michelle.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.400
 Now, you will have a first-class compartment to yourself

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.100
 my friend about to where will you go away have moved

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.700
 into the coach from Athens.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.500
 It is attached to the train here.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.500
 Now, you are sure I'm not putting you to any inconvenience

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.400
 not the least.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.200
 It is more convenient like this you are going through

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:28.800
 to Calais.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.200
 So it is better that you stay in this coach.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.000
 They Athens part of the train is empty except for

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.800
 for a Greek doctor and myself your compartment is

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.600
 not the one next to your good friend.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:39.900
 Mr.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.500
 Ratchett.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.400
 Would you like Michel to show you how it is animal you

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.300

 show out in India Colonel.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.800
 Hey, I didn't expect to see you miss you.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.700

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.800
 I was merely changing my compartment.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.100
 My luggage has been moved into number one next to my

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.800
 boss.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.300

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.800
 Yes, thank you have been very kind but take another

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.300
 aspirin and go to sleep.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.300
 I'm sure you'll feel just fine in the morning.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.100
 I hope I will good night sleep tight.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.600
 Oh, good evening.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600
 Miss you good evening,

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.500
 Madam poor creature.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.600
 She's got the most frightful headache.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.400
 She's a Swede as far as I can make out.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.100
 She's a missionary of some sort of teaching one.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.200
 I thought you were down the other end.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.400
 No, I

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.800
 Moved into the compartment of missed you bro.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.000
 Number one on the other side of mr.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.600
 Ratchett.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.100
 That is the one there's something wrong about that

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.600
 man.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.000
 My daughter always said I'm very intuitive and I've

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.100
 got a hunch about mr.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:10.800
 Ratchett.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.200
 I've got the compartment next to his on this side and

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.900
 I can tell you I don't like it one bit.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.500
 I put all my grips against the communicating door.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.300
 I thought I heard him trying the handle.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:21.900
 I daresay.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.400
 I'm foolish.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.600
 But there it is one can never be too careful in this

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.500
 is how about I'm downright.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.400
 Scared of him.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.600
 My daughter said I'd have an easy Journey,

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.600
 but somehow I don't feel happy about it.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.600
 I guess I'll turn in and read good night.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.500
 Good night mother.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.300
 Good night,

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:43.900
 then mr.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.800
 Ratchett just a moment must have been yes.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.100
 Mr.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.700
 Ratchett.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.000
 Are they breakfast in the dining car tomorrow?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.300
 Make sure I get my usual.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.300
 I'll see to it.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:54.600
 Mr.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.300
 Ratchett.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:56.900
 Good night.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.200
 Mr.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.900
 Ratchett.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.900
 Evidence of mr.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.500
 Shepherd manager of the bank the emerald was deposited

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500
 with him on March 25th by mr.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.800
 Patrick the family solicitor other April the 15th.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.200
 Mr.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.800
 Patrick.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:30.400
 I'm getting to fatigue a for all this time to go to sleep.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.100
 Which was that?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.600
 Nightmare must have been.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.700
 The train is not moving.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.600
 Are we at the station?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.500
 And show everything sound so loud when the train is

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.400
 not moving.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:30.100
 Oh, that's no one are asleep of this Percy train as

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:30.200
 well.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.200
 What can I do for you?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.300
 So long I could have been married in here.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.500
 There's someone in my compartment.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.600
 Let me see some moves that he's there is the one who

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.900
 must have been a nightmare.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.300
 Good night,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.000
 Madam sleep well.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.300
 Cheers everyone on this trend mad.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.200
 Yes, miss you.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.400
 Can I help you?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.100
 Watch his happening ways of train not moving.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.500
 Right is most unfortunate.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.600
 We have run into a snowdrift heaven knows how long

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.400
 we shall be here.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.200
 The snow is falling very heavily already.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.600
 It is up to the top of the windows.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.900
 It could be days before the line is clear days.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.100
 I fear so Mercy,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.200
 where are we between vincovci and Broad and as if we

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:24.800
 did not have enough

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.100
 Of trouble the American lady had her shouting.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.100
 She insists her absolutely insist that there was

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.200
 a man in her compartment and just imagine miss you.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.100
 How could anyone conceal themselves in a space this

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.700
 size but you would not listen to reason as if there

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.800
 was not enough to worry about well,

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.800
 I am sorry to add to your troubles my friend,

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.100
 but if I might have a little bottle of mineral water,

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:50.900
 of course,

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.500
 Monsieur straightaway.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:22.700
 nothing

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.200
 a woman in a red kimono walking away down the corridor.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.400
 Decidedly I suffer from the nerves.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.300
 My daughter told me I wouldn't have any trouble just

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.200
 get on the train.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.000
 She said sit tight and you'll be in Paris in no time.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.600
 And now we may be here for days and days my boat sails

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.100
 the day after tomorrow.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.000
 I can't even want to cancel my passage sister and her

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.300
 children are waiting me up.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.900
 I can't get no word to them.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.100
 They will think something terrible has happened

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.900
 me doesn't anyone have any idea.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.200
 How long would like you to be here?

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:09.800
 I'm sorry.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.500
 This country anyway,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.200
 Yugoslavia, I believe.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.100
 Oh one of those Balkan things what can you expect I

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.000
 suppose at some people come along and dig us out in

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.500
 the end.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.100
 We should just have to sit here and wait,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.300
 you're a very patient man was a else can one do uh,

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.000
 you're a philosopher that implies a detached attitude.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.600
 I think my own attitude is more selfish.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.000
 I've learned to save myself useless emotion Excuse

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.100
 Me.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:37.600
 Miss you.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.800
 Yes, what is it?

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.200
 Miss?

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:39.800
 You book him?

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.900
 Presents his compliments he would be grateful if

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.000
 you would be so kind as to spare him a few minutes of

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.600
 your time.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.500
 But of course,

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.300
 excuse me,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.100
 ha my good friend coming you too Michelle Mon Ami,

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.600
 we have need of you what has occurred.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.000
 You may well ask if you dwell not enough that we are

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.400
 cut off from the World by the snow at the end now a passenger

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.800
 lies dead in his birth stabbed which passenger

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.500
 Mr.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.200
 Ratchett the man in the next compartment to you,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.600
 which the ratchet that is very curious curious.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.500
 It is a disaster a murder itself would be serious enough

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.400
 but consider the circumstances who knows how long

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.800
 we may be stuck in the snow and there is something else

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.200
 passing through most countries.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.900
 We have the local police on the train,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.100
 but here it is not so much.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.300
 He's a position of great difficulty for you.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.800
 I agree but and there is worse to come.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:38.300
 Dr.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.400
 Constantine says

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.400
 Oh, forgive me for not introducing you but my mind

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400
 is in a world.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.700
 What is the company going to say to all this here?

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.000
 I am dr.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.200
 Constantine and I am a cure caramel.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:51.800
 Dr.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.400
 Constantine is of the opinion that the man was killed

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.700
 between midnight and 2:00 in the morning.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.700
 It is difficult to say exactly in these matters,

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.600
 but that would be my guess.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.300
 When was the crime discovered.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.700
 I shall leave that to our conductor Michelle tell

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.700
 me show you exactly what happened the valet.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.800
 Just your ratchet.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.900
 Mr.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.600
 Masterman had instructions to order breakfast for

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.100
 his master in the dining car when Miss uh,

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.200
 it did not appear and he could receive no answer from

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.300
 the compartment.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.600
 He asked me for help,

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.000
 but I was this about 11.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.100
 I opened the door of the compartment with my keyboard.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.500
 The chain was fastened across I broke the chain.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.400
 I thought at first that the gentleman must have had

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.000
 a fit,

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.800
 but then I saw her over Stockton fire.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.500
 And on the inside it was not suicide doesn't man who

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.600
 commits suicide the stabbed himself in 10 or 12 different

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.100
 places.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.000
 And that shows great ferocity.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.200
 It must have been a woman only a woman would kill a man

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.600
 like that if it was a woman she must have been very strong.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.700
 Some of the blows were delivered with such Force as

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.200
 to drive through hard belts of muscle and bone.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.100
 It was not clear a very scientific crime.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.600
 The question is what are we to do now?

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.300
 Mr.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:08.800
 Poirot?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.800
 I know your past.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.700
 I beseech you please take command of the investigation

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.000
 but Monsieur book I can scarcely no no,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.500
 please do not refuse just think eventually the Yugoslav

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.500
 police will arrive how it's simple if we can present

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.000
 them with a solution simple,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.300
 but if we do not there will be interminable delays

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.300
 and annoyances and endless embarrassment for the

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:31.800
 company.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.500
 But if you can tell the police,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.700
 this is the criminal your faith touches me Monsieur

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.200
 book and I must admit this

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.000
 um intrigues me.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.200
 I was reflecting not 30 minutes ago that many hours

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.100
 of boredom lay ahead of me while we are stuck here.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:53.000
 And now a problem arrives ready to my hand.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.500
 Then you will accept seven from you.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 You can place the matter in my hand.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.900
 I cannot express my gratitude.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.600
 We are all that yourself not to begin with I should

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.900
 like a plan of the Istanbul Kelly coach with a note

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.500
 of the people who occupy the compartments and I should

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:09.800
 also

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.200
 Like to see the tickets and their passports Michelle

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.600
 will use seated at least of course Monsieur book.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.700
 Now what other passengers are on the train if you are

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.700
 in the Athens coach,

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.200
 dr.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.800
 Constantine and I are the only Travelers beyond that

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.300
 of the ordinary carriages,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.000
 but they do not concern us since they were locked off

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.600
 from this part of the train after dinner had been served

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.400
 last night and forward of the Istanbul Calico cheese

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.900
 only the dining car then it seems as though we must

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.900
 look for a murder in the Istanbul Calais coach at half

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.500
 an hour.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.900
 At midnight we run into the snowdrift.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.600
 No one can have left the train since then so we have

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.300
 established two things.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.400
 The murderer is with us still on the train and he or

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.800
 she is a passenger on the stumble Calais coach.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.800
 Will you need to question all of them?

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.000
 Certainly Monsieur book now,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.300
 we must find somewhere to conduct the interviews.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.000
 I will get Michelle to clear the passengers out of

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.100
 the restaurant car.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.400
 Yes, Michel we must put

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.300
 I'm in a list be sure but he has worked with the company

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:19.900
 for years.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.700
 Nevertheless.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.800
 We must Overlook.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.800
 No one now.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.800
 I think that why they are clearing the restaurant

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.200
 Chi we should pair call on.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:27.600
 Mr.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.700
 McQueen.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 He may be able to Enlighten us about his late employer.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.600
 So they got him after all what exactly do you mean by

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.000
 that freshness to my queen?

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.700
 I must get this clear.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.000
 Who exactly are you gentlemen and where do you come

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.300
 in?

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.900
 I am a director the lock open internationally regularly

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.100
 and this gentleman is a detective active on my behalf.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.200
 My name is accurate promo,

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.800
 you know the name perhaps my ass.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.800
 It does seem kind of familiar only I thought it was

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.800
 some kind of a woman's dress maker it is.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.200
 Watch incredible.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.600
 Hmm.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:06.700
 Just nothing.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.400
 Let us continue.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.800
 I want you to tell me mr.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.900
 McQueen all that,

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.400
 you know about the dead man,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.500
 you were not related to him.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:21.300
 No, I am I was his secretary for how long have you held

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.000
 that post just over a year.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.100
 I met mr.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.900
 Ratchett when I was in Persia looking into an oil concession.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.100
 We had all gone rather badly.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.400
 Mr.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.400
 Ratchett was staying in the same Hotel.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.700
 He just fired the guy who'd been a secretary.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.500
 He offered me the job and I took it.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.900
 I was glad to find a well-paid job ready-made as it

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.700
 were and what did it involve very little mr.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.100
 Ratchett.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.500
 Wanted to see the world.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.600
 He was hampered by knowing the languages.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.800
 I work more as a courier than as a secretary.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.300
 It was a pleasant life.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.500
 No tell me all you can about your employer.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.200
 That's not so easy.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.400
 I know very little about them at all.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.400
 Mr.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.800
 Ratchett never spoke about himself or his life in

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.500
 America.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.600
 Do you think that was I don't know I guess he might have

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.600
 been ashamed of his Beginnings some men are but you

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.900
 must have found some theory about him.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.800
 Well, yes,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.200
 I did for one thing.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.300
 I don't believe wretched was his real name.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.300
 I think he left American order to escape somebody

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.000
 or something and he was pretty successful until a

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 few weeks ago.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.700
 What happened then he began to get letters threatening

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.000
 letters.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.100
 Did he show them to you?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.000
 Oh, yes.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.700
 There was my business to attend to his correspondence.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.800
 It's the first letter came about two weeks ago.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.000
 I got them in my briefcase.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.800
 Do you want to see them?

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.400
 Of course?

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.100
 This is why you said so they got him after all that's

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.900
 right Kor this was the first letter.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.200
 Thought you'd double-cross us and get away with it.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.300
 Did you we are out to get your ratchet and we will get

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.000
 you and this came a few days later.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.200
 We are going to take you for a ride ratchet sometime

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:04.800
 soon.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.500
 We are going to get you huh?

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.600
 How very curious pretty crude are.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.900
 They this one was obviously written by two people

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.800
 each writing a letter of a word at a time now tell me

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.200
 how did

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.500
 Strategy to react when he received the first he passed

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.400
 it off with a laugh but I could see there was quite a

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.500
 lot going on underneath now.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.400
 Tell me honestly.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.700
 Did you like your employer?

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.000
 Mr.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:32.500
 McQueen?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.800
 No, I did not and why was that to tell you the truth?

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.000
 I disliked and mistrusted him.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.100
 He seemed to me to be a cruel and dangerous man.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.300
 That's just a hunch.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.300
 I got no proof of it.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.200
 Well, thank you for being so honest.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 One further question.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.800
 When did you last see?

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.200
 Mr.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.800
 Ratchett alive last evening about ten o'clock.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.200
 I went into his compartment to take down some memoranda

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.900
 from him on what subject no,

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.800
 nothing very exciting some stuff about tiles and

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.100
 antique Pottery heat button,

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:04.700
 Persia.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.700
 Well, that is all for the present.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:06.900
 Mr.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.500
 McQueen.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.600
 I should be obliged if you would keep the matter of

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:10.900
 mr.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.600
 Ratchets death to yourself for a little time.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.700
 I'll do my best.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.100
 Thank you.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.300
 Mr.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:15.800
 McQueen.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.800
 I shall be interviewing all the other passengers

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.400
 in the restaurant Cavalry soon.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.600
 But first I am I think I had a better view the body but

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.700
 you will forgive me if I do not accompany you more shareable

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.400
 to one look was quite enough.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.200
 I thought it best to leave the window open since that

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.200
 is the way we found that you did right doctor,

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.700
 but it's his room bitterly cold in here in my opinion.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.500
 This open window is an attempt to deceive us that the

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.100
 murderer left that way but if he had that would have

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.800
 been traces in the snow even supposing that he could

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.500
 have got through it at all as you can see there is nothing

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.500
 agree with you doctor.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.700
 And since there are no fingerprints.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.300
 I think we may safely close the window.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.400
 The body is exactly as I found it.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.900
 I opened the pajama jacket.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.700
 That is all.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.400
 Mmm.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.300
 Just not pretty someone must have stood here and stabbed

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.100
 him again.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:18.700
 And again,

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.600
 how many wounds are there?

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.200
 Exactly they seem to be 12,

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.700
 but it is difficult to tell the blows seem to have been

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.300
 delivered in a moose haphazard and random way one

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.900
 more to Jesus light as to be practically scratches

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.300
 on the other hand.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.600
 At least three would be capable of causing death and

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.900
 there is something else that puzzles me and what is

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.300
 that?

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:48.500
 You see these two wounds here and here they are deep

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.000
 each cut must have severed blood vessels and yet the

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.600
 edges do not Gabe.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.400
 They have not played as one would have suspected which

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.200
 suggests that the man was already dead sometime dead

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.300
 when the blows were delivered,

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.000
 but that is surely absurd.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400
 It would seem so.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:11.000
 And there is one other thing you see this wound here

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.100
 under the radar.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.300
 Could you pretend to deliver such a blue here take

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:17.800
 my picture?

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.800
 Ah, I see what you mean with the right hand.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.300
 It is almost impossible.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:30.600
 But if the blow was struck with the left hand exactly

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.700
 and yet some of these other blows are obviously right-handed

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.800
 two people were

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.500
 Followed in writing the threatening letters was

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.500
 the killing also carried out by two people was the

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.300
 electric light on know the light over the bed had been

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.700
 turned off and Beyond so we have here a hypothesis

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.900
 of the first and second murderer as the great Shakespeare

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:02.000
 will put it the first murderer stabbed his victim

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.200
 and left the compartment turning off the light the

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.000
 second murder.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.600
 Er, er came in in the dark and stabbed at least twice

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.200
 at a dead man.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.100
 What do you think of that?

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.400
 Most ingenious?

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.400
 You think so,

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.300
 it sounded to me a little like nonsense what other

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.100
 explanation can there be that is just what I am asking

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:26.900
 myself.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.200
 Are there any other things that would pointed to people

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.400
 being involved?

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.400
 I think that are some of the Blues must have been a relatively

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.200
 feeble While others required great strength.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.800
 You mean they could only have been delivered by a man

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.300
 book, but young vigorous athletic woman might have

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:44.800
 struck them,

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.900
 especially if she were in the grip of a strong emotion,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.600
 but in my opinion it is most unlikely and the victim

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.600
 The victim what does she doing all this?

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.500
 Does he cry out as he struggle?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.300
 Does he you see a piston then?

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:14.000
 Why did he not use it but there's a class on the washbasin.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.800
 That's why drugged yes,

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:25.100
 and in the ashtray some fragments of charred paper.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.600
 What do they have to tell us?

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.900
 There's something on the floor hmm a dainty little

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.600
 cambric handkerchief with an initial embroidered

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.900
 on it each then our friend mrs.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.100
 Rooke was right.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.500
 There is a woman concerned in haste.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.800
 Most conveniently.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.200
 She leaves a handkerchief behind.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.100
 I'd and to make things easier for us.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.900
 It is marked with an initial ha ha what have we here?

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.600
 Pipe cleaner And as far as I know ratcheted not smoke

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.600
 a pipe valuable clue and dropped most conveniently

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.600
 for us to find was there any sign of a weapon none at

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:02.900
 all?

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.000
 But I fail to notice this when I examined the dead man

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.400
 his watch it was in his pajamas book and it has been

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.600
 so badly dented that.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.200
 It has stopped at a quarter past one.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.200
 If that is the time,

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.000
 he was attacked then that degrees exactly with my

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 own calculations,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.700
 which is possible doctor.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.500
 It's certainly possible.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:30.000
 But what I need now is a woman's old-fashioned hatbox.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.100
 What on Earth for perhaps the conductor will be able

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.800
 to help me.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.200
 I don't understand what you are trying to do Monsieur

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:39.700
 Poirot.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.000
 Can you explain it is fortunate that the Swedish lady

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.100
 should be so far behind the times these two humps of

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.900
 wire were intended to keep the Hat in shape.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.200
 I trust you will not miss it.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.400
 But what are you planning to do with it now watch carefully

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.200
 doctor if I put this fragment of chart paper,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.300
 which we found in the ashtray between these two camps

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:04.100
 of wire and heat it slowly over my little Spirit lamp.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.600
 We may find something which meter is about the car.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.500
 I'm I don't understand you.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.800
 What do you expect to find from the burnt paper watch

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.400
 carefully doctor the paper is now held in place by

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.700
 the wire cages if I light the spirit lamp and hold it

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.900
 under the paper.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.700
 Do you see something is appearing.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.600
 Can you read it?

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:32.600
 I can just make out the words member little Daisy Armstrong

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.600
 Daisy Armstrong it is

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.500
 Enough, it gives you something it does.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.500
 I know the real name of the dead man.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.600
 I know why he had to leave America.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.600
 What was his name Cassidy cassetti it brings back

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.300
 something to me.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.000
 But I cannot remember it was a crime in America.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.500
 Was it not?

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:56.800
 Yes.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.900
 It was in America the Armstrong baby,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.800
 of course,

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.400
 the little girl who was kidnapped and murdered Colonel

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.600
 Armstrong was an

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.100
 Dishman a distinguished Soldier fvc.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.700
 He married the daughter of Linda Arden.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.100
 Linda Arden was a very famous actress in a time of great

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.100
 celebrity the Armstrongs lived in America and had

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.800
 one child whom they worshipped when she was three

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.400
 years old.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.000
 She was kidnapped and an impossibly high some demanded

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.800
 as the price of her return and after the money had been

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.000
 handed over they found the little girl's body shell

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 been dead for at least of all night her mother Sonia

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.600
 Armstrong was

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.300
 Expecting another child at the time the baby was born

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.100
 dead and mrs.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.500
 Armstrong died shortly after her poor husband shot

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.800
 himself wasn't there another death?

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.800
 The housemaid was some real she was French O Swiss.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.500
 I think I can't remember now but police were convinced

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.100
 that she was somehow involved and in the feet of Despair

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.300
 she threw herself out of the window and it was subsequently

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.800
 proved that she was absolutely Innocent,

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.700
 but surely the kidnapper was arrested wasn't oh,

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.200
 yes.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:04.500
 Yes.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.600
 Cassidy was arrested he was

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.100
 Ahead of a kidnapping Syndicate and enormously Rich.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.900
 He was also a blackmailer either through massive

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.800
 bribery or through fear of some private Scandal the

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800
 court acquitted him.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.200
 There were some technical inaccuracies in the indictment.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.900
 You can well imagine the public outrage Cassity managed

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.300
 to get out of the country before he was lynched.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.800
 So presumably he has been living abroad under an assumed

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.100
 identity all this time.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.300
 I cannot regret that he is dead.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.800
 He deserved to die a hundred even so my friend of murder

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.000
 is a murder and it has to be investigated.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.600
 Do you think that the letter was deliberately burn

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.700
 so that Cassidy's that could not be connected with

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.700
 lobster almost certainly are there any members of

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.100
 the Armstrong family still living that unfortunately,

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:53.800
 I do not know.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.900
 I think I remember hearing of a younger sister of Sonia

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.200
 Armstrong, but I cannot be sure that is what is so difficult

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.600
 about our present situation.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.900
 We are cut off from the world.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.700
 No telephone no way of verifying the identity of the

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.600
 passengers.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.800
 So this lady could be among the people traveling on

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.600
 this train that remains to be seen.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.500
 How about the restaurant car must have been cleared

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.700
 by now it is time to commence the examination.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.800
 Perhaps we might start with the conductor pure Michelle.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.300
 He has been with the company for 15 years and he has

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.400
 an excellent record honest and conscientious,

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.900
 but he's worried that someone might have

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.300
 Him responsible.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:38.000
 He's not remarkable for his brain power.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.200
 It is a terrible thing to happen in all these years

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.300
 working for the company.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.800
 I have never known anything like you calm yourself

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.300
 my friend.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.600
 Let us concentrate on the facts of the case at what

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.200
 hour did mr.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.600
 Ratchett retire for the night almost immediately

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.600
 after dinner with you.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.100
 It was before we left the belgrad.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.400
 Did anyone go into his compartment of so,

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.600
 it's his valet.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.200
 Mr.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.400
 Masterman and this is the last you saw or heard no mercy,

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.400
 he rang his Bell about 20 to 1 and soon after we had stopped

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:10.500
 it.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.700
 Snow tell us what happened.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.900
 I knocked on his door,

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.100
 but he called that he had made a mistake in English

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.700
 or French in French.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.700
 He said scenario is you must be thrown pay that is true.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.200
 I heard him myself and then you went away the he has

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:26.600
 missed you.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.400
 I went to answer another bill that are just wrong.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.000
 And where were you at a quarter past one.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.300
 I was at my seat at the end facing up the corridor.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.100
 You never left it I did but only for a moment then I went

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.500
 into the atoms coach to speak.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.700
 To my colleague about the snow that must have been

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.800
 soon after one o'clock and 22 return one of my bells

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.200
 rang.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.000
 You will remember miss you the American lady was certain

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.700
 that somebody was in her compartment.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:58.000
 And after that you yourself rang and then I went to

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.900
 make up the bed in miss you McQueen's compartment

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.200
 and after that after that I sat in my seat until morning

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.300
 and did you notice any of the passengers moving up

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.500
 or down the corridor?

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.500
 Although one of the ladies went to the toilet?

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.200
 The far end.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.700
 I think the system is,

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.800
 uh, it's compartment.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.300
 Yes.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.400
 Miss you Brooke Which lady I do not know Monsieur.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.100
 She had her back to me.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.900
 Oh, she was wearing a red kimono with dragons on it.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.700
 Let us pass to another matter supposing that an assassin

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.200
 joined the trend and notice last night could he have

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.200
 left it after committing the crime.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.200
 I don't see how he could have done.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.700
 The snow was right up to the doors and windows.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.000
 Could he be concealed anywhere on the train?

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.400
 No, no.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.900
 No, there has been a most thorough search.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.500
 It is impossible that besides no one could get into

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.400
 the sleeping car without my seeing them.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:47.700
 Now.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.900
 The last stop was vincovci.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:50.500
 Was it not?

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.100
 Yes Monsieur we should have left there at 11:55,

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.900
 but we were nearly 20 minutes late because of the snow.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.300
 Where did you yourself descend from the train?

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.100
 Yes, miss you.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.200
 I got down on the platform as usual and stood by the

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.400
 step up into the Train the other conductors did the

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.700
 same one thing more.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.500
 You said that another Bell.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.900
 And while you were knocking at mr.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.900
 Richards dog responds it princess dragomiroff,

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.900
 so she asked me to summon her mate,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.300
 you did.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.200
 So yes Miss You Right Touch is all for the moment.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.700
 Monsieur does not blame me.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.300
 All you have had the evil chance.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.200
 My friend do not distress yourself.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.200
 Could you tell me who our last issue that all was not

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.400
 well with misdirected his valet.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:33.800
 Mr.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.400
 Masterman.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.800
 Ah, then I think we had better see him next huh?

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.400
 Miss your book I have

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.600
 Ducted the men to clear the snow from the doors and

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.300
 windows.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.000
 I trust that is in order.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.900
 There is no chance that the murderer May Escape into

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.200
 the snow nor Monsieur.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.700
 It is piled up at least six feet on either side of the

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.900
 track then go ahead and send a message.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.700
 You must a man along to us.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.600
 Are there was nothing unusual about his being late

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.100
 for breakfast or sometimes he wouldn't get up until

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:04.900
 lunchtime.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.700
 But last night he made a particular point about my

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.000
 ordering his breakfast.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.100
 That was why I was worried when he didn't answer at

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.200
 what time did you last see mr.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.300
 Ratchett, so it must have been about nine o'clock

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:16.900
 last night.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.500
 So I wore little laughter and was there anything about

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.300
 his manner that struck you as unusual?

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.900
 I think he was upset they inward to way over literally

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:27.700
 been reading.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.000
 He wanted to know how it

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.000
 Came to be in his compartment.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.200
 He inferred that I might have put it there because

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.500
 I told him that it was nothing to do with me.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.200
 Then he started fighting fault with things.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.100
 He could be extremely trying when he was in a bad mood

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.700
 or was your master in the habit of taking a sleeping

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.700
 draft her always when traveling by train sir.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.200
 He said he couldn't sleep.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.200
 Otherwise it.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.200
 ready for him.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.900
 You didn't actually see him drink it.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.300
 Oh, no,

 Masterman.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.300
 What was your opinion of your employer?

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.700
 I have always made a point of never having an opinion

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.800
 of my employers,

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.300
 but even so mr.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.500

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.400

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:38.600

 Do you remember reading in the papers of the Armstrong

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.500

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.800
 Oh, yes indeed,

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.100

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.100
 Well, they're a shocking Affair.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.900

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.400

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:56.800

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.500
 Heard what I can't believe it is that true?

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.300
 It is true.

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:01.600

 Mr.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:08.600

 Does she speak English?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.600
 Well a kind of English.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.500

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.000

 Oh, no,

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:31.900
 sir.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.800
 I find it highly enjoyable,

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.000
 sir.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.200
 Well, let us continue you return to your compartment

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.800
 and read loves captive children or what about 10:30

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.700
 The Italian Job?

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.300
 Woman wanted to go to bed.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.400
 So the conductor came and made the beds up and then

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.700
 you went to bed and to sleep.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.700
 I went to bed sir,

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.500
 but alas not to sleep.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:13.400
 And why was that I had to think just very painful toothache.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.700
 Did you do anything for it?

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.500
 Well, I applied some oil of cloves which relieve the

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.700
 pain little but I was still not able to get to sleep.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.800
 I turned the light on over my bed and went on reading

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.800
 to take my mind off it.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.400
 And signor foscarelli.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.100
 Oh, he slept very soundly,

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.300
 so he snored a good deal,

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.800
 which was particularly trying did he leave the compartment

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.200
 at all during the night?

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:38.600
 Oh, no,

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:38.800
 sir.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:39.700
 And did you?

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:40.100
 Oh, no,

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:40.400
 sir.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:40.900
 No.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.000
 Well, there seems very little else to be said.

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:46.700
 Oh, by the way,

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.400
 are you a pipe smoker?

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:49.900
 Oh, no,

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.300
 sir.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.800
 I just the occasional cigarette.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:53.800
 Thank you.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.100
 Mr.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.700
 Masterman that we do.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.800
 I hope you won't think me presumptuous in mentioning

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.300
 it sir,

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.500
 but the American lady mrs.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.000
 Hubbard is in something of a state is carrying on rather

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.200
 considerably.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.900
 She said she knows all about the murderer.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.200
 I thought you ought to know sir.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.200
 Well, thank you very much for drawing my attention

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.800
 to it in that case.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.300
 We had better see her straightaway.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.100
 Would you be so kind as to ask her to come along?

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:21.900
 Of course?

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.600
 What I've got to tell you is this I've heard they're

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.200
 saying there was a murderer on the train last night.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:34.400
 Well, the murderer was in my compartment you are certain

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.200
 of this Madam.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:35.700
 Of course,

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:39.000
 I'm certain I was asleep and suddenly something woke

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.300
 me up and I knew right away.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.500
 There was a man in my compartment.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.700
 And so scared I couldn't even scream I lay there and

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.000
 I thought I'm going to be killed what the hell was that?

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.500
 It is nothing but I'm a bird.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.500
 They are just clearing the snow from the windows just

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.400
 a bag of nerves.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.700
 I don't know what my daughter would say.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.800
 Where was I you thought you were going to be killed?

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.100
 Well somehow I got my wits together and I felt about

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:07.900
 with my hand.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.200
 I pressed the bell for the conductor I rang and rang

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200
 but nothing happened.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.400
 I could tell you I thought my heart was going to stop

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.000
 beating Mercy.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.700
 I thought to myself maybe they've murdered everyone

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.600
 on the train train was at a standstill and there was

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.600
 an eerie silence everywhere.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.200
 That I heard footsteps coming along the corridor

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.000
 and the conductor knocked at the door ice cream.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.700
 Did it become easy and I switch the light on and would

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:41.200
 you believe it wasn't a soul that are you sure it wasn't

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.600
 just a nightmare Madam.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.200
 That's just what the conductor said.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:46.800
 He was convinced.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.000
 I dreamed up the whole damn thing.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.900
 I made him look under the seat though.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.400
 He said there wasn't room for the man squeezed himself

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:54.900
 in there.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.100
 It was plain enough that someone

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.800
 Had been in and had got away again.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.600
 But how do you think he could have got away?

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.300
 Well, you know,

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:07.400
 I got into my head and it was a man from the next compartment

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.200
 the fellow that's been killed.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.500
 I have to admit I didn't like the look of him from the

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.300
 start.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.100
 There was something about him that really frightened

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:15.400
 me.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.100
 I told the conducted look at the connecting door between

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.900
 my compartment and his and sure enough.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.100
 It wasn't bolted but Madam if you were so frightened

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:23.800
 of this man,

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.900
 why didn't you make sure that the door was bolted before

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.100
 you

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.200
 Went to sleep.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.300
 Oh I did you did as a matter of fact,

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.300
 I asked that Swedish lady to see if it was bolted and

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.700
 she said it was uh,

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.000
 how was it that you could not see it yourself because

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.400
 I was lying down on my bed and my sponge bag was hanging

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.700
 on the door handle.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.000
 She'd come into my compartment to see if I got an aspirin

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.500
 and what time was this?

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.100
 It must have been round Pebbles 10 or Court to 11 poor.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.800
 So she wasn't a state if she even opened the door of

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.100
 the next compartment by

00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.900
 Take miss you red shirts.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.200
 She was mostly stressed about it.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.000
 He laughed apparently and I rather fancy.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.100
 He said something not quite nice put sing.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:10.300
 She was all in a flutter it did you hear any noise from

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.700
 his torch its compartment not exactly.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:16.300
 What do you mean by that he snored and did you hear him

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:20.100
 snore after the scare about a man being in your compartment?

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.100
 How could I he was dead?

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:23.500
 Huh?

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.900
 Yes, how stupid of me?

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:27.800
 Mrs.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.500
 How about do you remember the affair of the Armstrong

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.300
 kidnapping?

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.200
 Yes indeed I do and that evil killer got clean away

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:37.700
 with it.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.600
 I'd have been happy to turn the switch on the electric

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.600
 chair myself.

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.900
 You did not get away with it.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.300
 Mrs.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:43.700
 Hubbard.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.100
 He is dead.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.800
 He died last night.

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:53.000
 You mean it was him the man next door didn't I say you

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.200
 had an evil face?

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.100
 My daughter says I got a nose for that.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.100
 Anything.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.200
 Oh, are you acquainted with any of the other strong

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:00.900
 family matter?

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.900
 No, they moved in a very exclusive Circle,

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.200
 but I've always heard mrs.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.500
 Armstrong with a perfectly lovely woman and her husband

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.100
 worshipped her.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:08.300
 Mrs.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:08.800
 Hubbard.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.100
 You have helped us very much.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.300
 Oh, by the way,

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.500
 Do you have a Scarlet silk?

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.700
 Kimono Rosie me?

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.500
 What a question.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.500
 I've got to dressing gowns.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.600
 The matter of fact,

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.100
 there's a pink flannel one.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.100
 That was quite cozy on board ship and a purple silk

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:25.400
 Affair.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.400
 My daughter gave me.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.400
 Why do you want to know about a Scarlet one?

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.600
 Tell me it sounds interesting.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.100
 Oh, well you see Madam someone in a kimono of that color

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.200
 entered your compartment or that of mr.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.600
 Ratchett last night.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.700
 I can tell you that.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.100
 No Scarlett kimono came into my room.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.400
 Then she must have gone into mr.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.100
 Richards.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.400
 That wouldn't surprise me.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.100
 Any do you mean that you had a woman's voice in his room?

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.900
 Well, yes,

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.700
 as a matter of fact I did but when I asked you just know

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.200
 if you heard anything from next door,

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.500
 you said you only had mr.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.500
 Hatchett snoring.

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.900
 No, it wasn't a very nice thing to talk about.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.900
 What's this before or after you thought there was

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.300
 a man in your compartment.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 It was before of course.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.700
 He wouldn't have had a woman talking to him.

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.600
 If he was dead,

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.200
 Woody decidedly,

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:20.500
 not how you must think I am a very slow widget and I didn't

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.400
 think there was a man in my room.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:23.500
 He was there.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.900
 All right and what's more I've got proof of it.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 You see this button.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.100
 It's certainly not one of mine.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:33.000
 I found it this morning when I got up but this

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.700
 Is a button from the tunic of a vague only attendant

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.100
 perhaps it came off the conductor's uniform and he

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:40.800
 was searching your room last night.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.300
 I just don't know.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.900
 What's the matter with you people.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.700
 Why can't you just accept what I saw I was reading a

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.700
 magazine when I turned the light out.

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.300
 I placed the magazine on a little case of standing

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.200
 over by the window.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.400
 Have you got that?

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.700
 Yes, Madam very well in the conductor looked under

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.600
 the seat from near the door and then he bolted the communicating

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:02.900
 daughter.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.500
 The next compartment he never went anywhere near

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.200
 the window.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.800
 She was only in my compartment of minute or so.

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.800
 Well this morning that button was lying right on top

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:12.700
 of the magazine.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.200
 What do you call that?

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:17.100
 I should like to know that matter.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.000
 I call evidence.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:19.600
 Oh, no,

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.500
 do you believe that?

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.100
 The killer was in my compartment last night?

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.100
 Well, do you

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 I simply cannot understand it Monsieur Poirot the

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.800
 button that mrs.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.600
 Hubbard found is undoubtedly that of a vague only

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.400
 conductors uniform is certainly very curious.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.100
 But does this mean that Michelle is somehow involved

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.100
 it simply cannot be he has been working for the company

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.100
 for 15 years of certain such as possibilities.

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:51.200
 I agree Monsieur book,

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.900
 but we must not allow ourselves to be sidetracked.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.500
 Let us consider the facts the murdered man of Ratchet

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.600
 was the kidnapper and killer of the arms.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.300
 Baby in America most likely cause of Investigation

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:07.400
 is to pursue a link between one of the passengers and

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.800
 the Armstrong family at we still have eight passengers

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.700
 to question in the first class.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.800
 There are princess dragomiroff count under knee

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.700
 and his beautiful young counters Colonel arbuthnot.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.300
 And mr.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.000
 Hardman who is an American if I'm not mistaken.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.700
 Hmm, and then there are the passengers in the second

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.600
 class you have not

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.900
 Yet interviewed file and Schmidt the princess has

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.900
 made Antonio first Carelli.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.100
 I miss debenham and the Swedish lady Miss Olson other

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.900
 one who looks rather like sheep that has lost its way

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:48.900
 and we well let us commence with her.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.600
 In the dead man was responsible for this terrible

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.200
 crime.

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.700
 Yes Mademoiselle.

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:59.200
 I had to sing at I nearly walked into his compartment

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.800
 last night you open his door.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.100
 It was a stupid mistake.

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.600
 I was much ashamed but did you actually see him and

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.200
 myself?

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.000
 Yes, I did.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.400
 He was reading a book.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:15.000
 I apologize quickly and close at all.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.700
 And did he say anything to you?

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.600
 He laughed and he said

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.600
 Said something which I did not quite understand I

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.300
 suspect it was not very polite.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.000
 And what did you do after that?

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.500
 It was the American lady.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:29.600
 I had gone to see mrs.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.200
 Hubbard.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.300
 I had a headache and she had offered me some aspirin

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.600
 and did she ask you whether the communicating door

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.300
 between her compartment and that of mr.

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.800
 Ratchett was bolted.

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:39.600
 Yes.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.300
 She did.

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:45.100
 I had a look and it was I understood why she was frightened.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.200
 I would not have liked to have slept next to Sashimi

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.100
 and after that my friend.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.100
 Back to my own compartment.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:55.900
 I took the aspirin and I lay down now you are sharing

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:56.800
 your compartment.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.400
 I believe Mademoiselle Olsen's.

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:58.800
 Yes.

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.000
 I am with English lady.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.600
 She was coming from Baghdad.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:08.200
 And did you have the above the lower berth as The Lure

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.300
 one and do the English lady Miss?

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:10.800
 Debenham.

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.200
 Did she leave the compartment after the train left?

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:13.900
 Vincovci?

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:14.300
 No.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.100
 No.

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.600
 I am sure that she did not I am very light sleeper if

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.100
 she had come.

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.000
 And from this bathtub of I should have awakened.

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.100
 Did you yourself?

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.800
 Leave the compartment at any time?

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.000
 I miss you not until this morning.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:28.600
 Mmm.

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.400
 I tell me Mademoiselle Rosen.

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.100
 Do you have a Scarlet silk?

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.000
 Kimono Scarlet silk?

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.800
 What should I do with such a garment?

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.600
 I have a good comfortable dressing-gown of Jager

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:46.000
 material and the lady with you miss debenham.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.700
 What color is addressing go?

 She has a pale mouth ever Sasha as you buy in the east.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.100
 Have you ever been an American man was a Torsen know

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:02.100
 I very nearly went there.

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.600
 Once I was to go is a companion to an invalid lady.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.200
 But at the last moment it was all canceled.

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.800
 It was a great pity.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.100
 I wished very much to see the United States.

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.400
 Thank you man.

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.400
 Was that is all that is all Yes,

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.600
 man was in Wilson.

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:22.900
 Do you wish I asked everyone to come along to talk with

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.000
 you for the moment.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.200
 No, goodbye then.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.400
 And I will tell you who is the murderer of my friend

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.200
 it is foscarelli.

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.300
 The big Italian who looks like a bandit that is the

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.900
 way they kill in Sicily with a knife and not once but

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.600
 many times it says in his passport that he was born

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:46.300
 in Milan what difference does it make it is quite obvious.

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:49.900
 He and this man the ratchet were in the kidnapping

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:50.900
 business together.

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:54.700
 What did you say ratchets real name was Cassity.

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:56.100
 Well, there you are then.

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.700
 Criminals always fall out with one another cassetti

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.600
 must have double cross this man the first Carelli

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.800
 and this is his revenge,

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.800
 forgive me for disturbing you must ebook but the chef

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.400
 is most anxious to speak with you.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.300
 He is very concerned about the supplies of food.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.900
 What is he to do for fresh vegetables Michelle this

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.700
 button was found in the american.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.000
 Ladies compartment.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:21.800
 It is yours.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.900
 I think no miss you Brooke.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:25.900
 There must be some mistake.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.300
 As you can see I have lost know button.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.100
 It is fairly certain that this button was dropped

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.500
 by the man who was in mrs.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.600
 Hobbs compartment last night when she rang the bell,

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.500
 but I have told you Matthew book.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.000
 There was no one there.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.600
 The lady must have imagined it even so Michele I should

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.300
 like you to talk to the other conductors on the train

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.900
 and make sure that they all have their buttons.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.900
 Yes, Matthew and perhaps you would be so kind as to

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.100
 ask the princess dragomiroff whether she wishes

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.200
 to present herself here.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:59.800
 Or whether she would prefer me to wait upon her in her

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800
 own compartment.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.300
 Yes, the Sea of course Monsieur ubu perhaps you should

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.500
 go and call upon the chef my friend.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.400
 You have the good name of the company.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.700
 They volunteer to consider we be sure but what about

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.900
 the investigation?

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:20.900
 Oh, I have no doubt that somehow or other I shall manage

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.900
 to conduct it in your absence.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.100
 There is no reason why I should be treated differently

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:35.000
 from any of the other passengers emerged has taken

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:35.500
 place.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.400
 You must interview everyone.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.900
 I understand my duty miss you you are most amiable.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:43.600
 Madam.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:49.000
 What can I tell you you are traveling home from Istanbul?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.100
 I understand.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:50.800
 Yes.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.300
 I have been staying at the Austrian Embassy.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.800
 Madame Le process for the purposes of my investigation.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.100
 I need a brief account of your movements last night

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:06.600
 from dinner onwards if you would be so kind movements.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:13.500
 I didn't move at all the conductor made up my bed while

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.300
 I was in the dining car.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.600
 I retired immediately after dinner.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.300
 I read until 11:00 the Memoir of sand Seymour and then

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:24.900
 turned out

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.500
 Out to my light but I couldn't get to sleep.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.600
 I suffer from a Rheumatic complaint that is particularly

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.500
 disturbing at night.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.400
 Most distressing.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.600
 I can understand what I'm at the party quarter to one

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.100
 I rang for my maid and asked her to massage me.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.500
 She then read aloud to me until I felt sleepy I cannot

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.900
 say exactly at what time she left me it might.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.800
 You've been half past one.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.800
 It might have been late of your maid know.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.900
 What is her name Hildegard Schmidt.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
 And has she been with you for a long time.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.400
 Our people came from an estate of my late husband's

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.300
 in Germany.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.900
 She has been in my service for 15 years.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.500
 You have been in America.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:23.900
 I presume a damn many times U where U at any time acquainted

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.900
 with the

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.100
 wrong family the family who suffered a great tragedy

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.400
 of the kidnapping and death of their little daughter.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.300
 They were personal friends of mine with you your new

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.100
 Colonel Armstrong welding.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:44.500
 I knew him slightly but his wife Sonia was my goddaughter

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.700
 and I was on terms of close friendship with her mother

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.000
 Linda Arden.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.900
 She was one of the great actresses of the world in

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.100
 France you would have been a renowned Fair draw and

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:58.900
 remark.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:03.700
 I always thought her wasted on the superficial entertainments

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.000
 of Broadway.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.200
 She is dead.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.700
 No, no,

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:11.500
 she is alive but she lives in complete retirement

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.600
 and seclusion.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:15.700
 Her health is very delicate and she has to lie on his

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:21.300
 sofa most of the time but why should you wish to know

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.600
 about the Armstrongs?

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800
 I will explain a lot.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
 I'm the man who was killed last night was the man who

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.100
 was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.000
 the Armstrong child.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:37.900
 Soupy.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.200
 That odious man was cassetti.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:48.800
 Then I can only say that his murder was entirely Justified.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.900
 Can you tell me anything about Sonya Armstrong's

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.900
 younger sister?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.200
 Do you know where she's living?

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.000
 I cannot tell you missed you.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.100
 I have lost touch with the younger generation.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.800
 I believe that she married an englishman's some time

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.400
 ago and presumably she went to live in England,

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:16.300
 but I cannot recall his name perhaps it will come to

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:16.800
 me.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.400
 Is there anything further you wish to ask me only one

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:23.700
 thing?

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.900
 I love France s

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.700
 Somewhat personal question.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.900
 What is the color of your dressing gown?

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.900
 I must suppose you have a reason for such a question.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.000
 My dressing gown is of blue.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.800
 Satin.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.800
 I am much obliged to you for answering my questions

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.200
 with such understanding.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.900
 You will excuse me Monsieur,

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.100
 but may I ask you your name?

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.900
 Your face is somehow familiar to me.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000
 My name is accurate Poirot acupressure.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.300
 How yes?

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:12.300
 I remember now this is Destiny.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.100
 Miss you.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.000
 It is nothing to be excited about am afraid Mon Ami,

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.100
 they are sounding the whistle in the hope that someone

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.200
 may hear us.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.900
 Things are becoming serious.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.700
 We have food only for another 24 hours.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.900
 There is no mineral water and the precious little

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:42.800
 caviar.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.400
 It is not the kind of service that our passengers expect

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.700
 on board the Orient Express and to cap it all you have

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.900
 a murderer on the train at least it provides a little

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.800
 diversity small,

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.200
 but are you any nearer a solution?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.300
 I have not yet completed my investigation.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.000
 So, who are you going to question next our content

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
 contest on trainee?

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.100
 They are from the Hungarian Embassy.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:10.800
 You must tread very cautiously there my friend.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.000
 I did not consider it necessary that my wife the contest

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.500
 should come along to see you as well.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.800
 There is little that we can do to assist you with her

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.100
 sleep and heard nothing.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.900
 Are you aware of the identity of the deceased Monsieur

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:26.400
 account?

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.300
 I understood that it was the American with the decidedly

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.600
 unpleasant face.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.100
 I mean did you know the name of the man?

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.900
 He was never introduced to me surely his name was on

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.500
 his passport the name on his passport was ratchet,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.500
 but his real name was cassetti.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.200
 Does that mean anything to you?

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.700
 Nothing at all?

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.100
 I'm afraid you have perhaps been an American Monsieur

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.700
 Le comte I've lost in the Embassy in Washington for

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.300
 a year.

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:58.900
 You knew perhaps the Armstrong family Armstrong.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.500
 It is difficult to recall one meets so many people

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.200
 but do come back to the matter of this man's death.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.400
 What more can I do to assist you?

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.300
 I need to know at what hour did you retire last night

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.800
 a un the countries have separate but adjoining compartments.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.700
 I think numbers 12 and 13.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:23.000
 We asked the conductor to make up number 12 for the

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.100
 night while we're in the dining car on returning we

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.200
 sat in the other compartment and played PK for a while.

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.900
 About 11 o'clock my wife retired to bed for the night

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.300
 the conductor made up my compartment.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.000
 I also went to bed.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:39.900
 I slept until morning and Madame La comtesse.

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:42.100
 My wife always takes a sleeping Draft when traveling

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:42.700
 by train.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.200
 She took her usual dose of try onal.

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:46.500
 I'm sorry.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.800
 I'm not able to assist you in any way now if possible,

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.300
 I would like to have a little word with Madame La comtesse.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.400
 It will not be necessary.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.500
 She can tell you nothing more than I already have doubtless

01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.300
 doubtless.

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:03.300
 Nevertheless, I must see her it will be a mere formality,

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:06.400
 but you understand it is necessary for my report.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.600
 As You Wish Monsieur I will ask my wife to call on you

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.100
 He didn't look very pleased.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.300
 What on Earth.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.300
 Did you say to her?

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.400
 You have the passports of the content contestants

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.100
 you book only it is here.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.600
 There is only one.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.100
 It is a joint passport.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:31.000
 He killed accompanied by his wife and oh someone has

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.100
 dropped a spot of grease on it.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.600
 What does it say?

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.500
 Elena Maria?

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:42.600
 I think maiden name Goldenberg H20.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600
 It is a diplomatic.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.900
 Sport we must be careful my friend not to give offense.

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.700
 We are investigating a murder Monsieur ubu even so

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.500
 the underneath are important people and it is important

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.000
 to the company Diwali that the Hungarian government

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.300
 him.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.800
 I am behaving with the utmost tact.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.200
 Miss you more we Michelle.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:01.800
 What is it?

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:04.200
 I have checked with the other conductors.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.200
 Neither of them has lost a button and they swear that

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.200
 they have never been near the compartment of Madame

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:11.700
 Uber.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.800
 Yeah, thank you.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.700
 Michelle Madame LA comtesse and ring is here Monsieur

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.100
 Poirot then ask her to be so kind as to come along.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.200
 Yes, miss you.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.700
 Will you come this way Madame La comtesse?

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.600
 I beseech you bro.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.300
 Do not say anything that might upset her.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.500
 I understand that you wish to question me Monsieur

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.100
 a mere formality in Medina contest,

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.500
 please sit down.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.900
 It is only to ask you if you saw or heard anything last

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.600
 night that may throw any light on this matter of the

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.300
 murder.

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:48.700
 Nothing at all.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:49.300
 Miss you.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:50.400
 I was asleep.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.700
 You did not here for instance a commotion going on

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:56.200
 in the compartment next to yours the American lady

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.600
 who occupies it became quite hysterical and rang

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.500
 for the conductor.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.600
 I had nothing Monsieur.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.100
 I had taken a sleeping draft,

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:04.800
 of course.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.000
 Well, I need not detain you any further.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.000
 Thank you.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:09.200
 Miss.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.100
 You're just a one little detail these particulars

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.500
 here on your passports your maiden name age and so

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.600
 forth they are correct.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.600
 Of course they are correct.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:26.500
 You will forgive me for asking but did you accompany

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.700
 your husband on his visit to Washington?

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:33.400
 No, we were not married then our wedding took place.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.300
 Only last year,

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.300
 of course.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:35.500
 Yes.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.600
 stupid of me

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.300
 And by the way,

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:41.500
 does your husband smoke?

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.000
 Yes, he does a pipe no cigarettes and cigars.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.200
 What makes you ask that question for you understand

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.300
 detectives asked all sorts of questions.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.700
 For instance.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.500
 What is the color of your dressing?

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.700
 I'm not I'm not going Tess.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:04.300
 It is cool College - is it really important?

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.900
 Very important indeed forgive me,

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.300
 but I do not quite understand what your function is

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.000
 in all this.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.500
 I saw that there were no detectives on the train on

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.100
 its Passage through Yugoslavia.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.600
 I am not a Yugoslavian detective Madam.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:25.000
 I am an international detective you mean that you

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.900
 belong to the League of Nations.

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:30.400
 I belong to the world madam.

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.700
 Thank you for your cooperation.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.600
 I hope that I have been of some assistance miss you.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.200
 I assure you of great assistance.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:47.200
 Well must you book was a sufficiently discreet at

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.800
 the very Soul Mercy very pretty woman,

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.900
 but it didn't Advance as much,

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.700
 you know to people who saw nothing and nothing.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.800
 I think that we should interview the handsome Colonel

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.600
 arbuthnot next my fear that you will not find in very

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.700
 cooperative.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.700
 I don't see that it's any of your business why I decided

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:18.400
 to return from India by the Overland route and nevertheless

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:18.900
 Colonel.

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:22.900
 If you really must know I wanted to take a look at Earl

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:23.800
 of the col deze,

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.800
 of course and there happened to be an old friend of

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.900
 mine in Baghdad who I haven't seen in five years.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.900
 Is that good enough for you?

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.000
 I understand that the young English did he miss debenham

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.600
 was also returning from back.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.100
 Dad.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.000
 Did you meet other perhaps know as

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.800
 Did not I first met Miss debenham in the restaurant

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.100
 car of the Taurus Express traveling from kirkuk to

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:47.400
 mr.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.100
 Bean Colonel.

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:52.700
 I have about to appear to you you and Miss debenham

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.800
 up of English.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.400
 It is necessary that I should ask each of you your opinion

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.500
 of the other what the devil do you mean by that the crime

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.300
 was most probably committed by a woman.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:06.600
 It has all the marks of that you can possibly suspect.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.100
 Mr.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.700
 Devlin as an Englishman you come to see things about

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.400
 her that I cannot.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.100
 What sort of person is she gonna live you seem to have

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:19.400
 some very peculiar Notions of the way English people

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:24.400
 behave Miss debenham is a lady and therefore she could

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.600
 not possibly be implicated in this crime.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.400
 Very idea is absurd the man was a perfect stranger.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.400
 She'd never seen him before did she tell you this not

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:38.100
 in so many words she commented on his somewhat unpleasant

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.000
 appearance if a woman really is

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.100
 Consent that I can't imagine on what assumptions

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.700
 you could have come to that conclusion Miss.

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.300
 Debenham is most certainly not the person you're

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.600
 looking for very well.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.900
 Let us pass on to matters of fact,

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.700
 we have reason to believe that the crime was committed

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.800
 at a quarter past 1:00 last night.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:00.100
 It is part of our necessary routine to ask everyone

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.300
 on the train what he or she was doing at the time the

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.900
 best of my recollection at a quarter past one.

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.900
 I was talking to that young American fellow McQueen

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.900
 the secretary to the dead man.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.300
 We were in his compartment.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.900
 He was a friend or acquaintance of yours never saw

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.400
 him before he got on this train.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.400
 We got talking about him Jack and he seemed to have

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.600
 some very peculiar Notions about how we run the place.

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.000
 I thought it my duty to set him to write we went on talking

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.200
 to Lily to clock.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.900
 I believe that you got out when the train stopped at

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:34.500
 Vin cooked see is that so reverse it McQueen and I that

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.500
 is but only for about a minute the cold with some frightful

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.900
 made me quite grateful to get back to the fug.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.100
 As a rule,

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.200
 I think these trains are scandalously overheated.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.900
 It is very difficult to please everyone the English.

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:52.400
 They open everything then others come along in the

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.400
 clothes everything which is want to do I can't understand

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.700
 why you fellows have such a rooted objection to Fresh

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.400
 Air's now: El Castillo man back.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.900
 You understand McQueen return to the train you sit

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.100
 down and smoke perhaps her cigarette,

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:11.600
 perhaps pipe the pipe for me the queen smoke cigarettes

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.900
 you carry on with your talk about the British Empire.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.000
 It is late.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.700
 Now many people have retired for the night.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.000
 Did anyone past your door now think carefully it's

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.100
 difficult to say the conductor went by a wait a minute.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.000
 There was a woman I think a woman can you describe her

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:32.200
 watch?

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.200
 Dorian I didn't see I just heard a rustle as she went

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.700
 by and the scent of some sort of what kind of scent can

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.600
 you describe it?

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:45.400
 Well, it was not a fruity if you know what I mean the

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.100
 kind of thing you could smell a hundred yards away.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.300
 And then again it was one of those things that you've

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.200
 noticed without noticing if you know what I mean,

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.500
 I know not tell me Colonel.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.100
 Have you ever been in America?

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.500
 Never?

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.200
 No desire to go that I did you ever know a colonel Armstrong?

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.500
 Long, I've known two or three.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.800
 It was a chap called Selby.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.200
 I'm strong got blown to pieces at passchendaele.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:10.300
 No.

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:13.600
 No, I mean the colonel Armstrong who married the daughter

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.000
 of the American actress Linda Arden and whose only

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.900
 child was kidnapped and killed.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.400
 I never actually came across him,

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.700
 but I know who you mean,

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.200
 of course Derby,

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:24.900
 I'm strong.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.000
 Everybody liked him a very distinguished Soldier.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.200
 He got the VC the man who was killed last night.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.200
 What's the man responsible for the murder of Colonel

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.700
 Armstrong's child then he deserved what was coming

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:39.200
 to him.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.000
 But I'd sooner have seen him hand or put in the electric

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.300
 chair.

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.300
 Do you prefer Law and Order to private Vengeance a

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.500
 man ought to be put on trial and judged by a properly

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.700
 constituted jury.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.400
 I don't know of a better system.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.500
 Yes, I can see that that would be your view.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.300
 Well, I do not think that there is anything as I need

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.200
 to ask you Colonel.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.300
 There's something I've just remembered.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.400
 Yes gonna what is it?

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.800
 It may be nothing at all.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.700
 But when I left McQueen and got back to my compartment,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.300
 I noticed that the door of the one Beyond mine the end

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:13.800
 one, you know,

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.900
 there's number 16.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.900
 Well the door of it was not quite closed and the fellow

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.700
 inside peered out in a furtive sort of way.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.400
 Then he quickly pulled the door,

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:23.900
 too.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.600
 It's probably nothing in it,

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.500
 but it struck me as rather altered the time.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.100
 Thank you,

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.200
 Canada and his most interesting.

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.800
 I'll be on my way then.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.700
 By the way about Miss Devon.

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:36.900
 Mm-hmm.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.900
 You can take it from me that she's all right.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.000
 She's fucking Saab.

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.400
 good day gentlemen

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.200
 What does he mean Poker SOB?

01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:54.100
 It means that Miss Debenhams father and brothers

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.900
 were at the same kind of schoolers gonna LaBeouf not

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:01.800
 I see then it has nothing to do with the crime at all.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.000
 What about the man who the canal saw peering round

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.100
 the door of his compartment under 16,

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.500
 who is the passenger in number 16 the mr.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:15.900
 Cyrus hardened and he looks just like a gangster but

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.300
 according to his passport.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.100
 He's a traveling.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.900
 Salesman for a company which sells the typewriter

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.800
 ribbons.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.600
 I think we should have him in next.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.100
 I think I better come clean.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.300
 I've heard of you.

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:30.600
 Mr.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.300
 Poirot.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.400
 You've got quite a reputation in our profession in

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.600
 our profession typewriter ribbons have passports

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.400
 a bit of a place.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.000
 I'm afraid I work for McNeil's detective agency in

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:43.700
 New York.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.100
 I think you had better explain.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:46.700
 Mr.

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:47.300
 Hardman.

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.000
 I've been training a couple of dope Smugglers.

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.200
 The trail went cold in Istanbul.

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:55.400
 I was going to go home with my tail between my legs when

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.500
 I got this letter.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.400
 You have been pointed out to me as an operator for the

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.100
 McNeil detective agency kind of report to my suite

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.100
 at the Tecate on hotel at four o'clock this afternoon.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.700
 SEO ratchet.

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:11.600
 It was a worried man.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:11.900
 Mr.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:12.500
 Poirot.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.000
 He showed me a couple of letters that someone had sent

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:15.500
 to him.

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.200
 He wanted me to travel on the train back to Paris with

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.900
 him and see that nobody got him.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.100
 I guess I didn't make out any too.

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.100
 Well, did he give you any precise instructions?

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.000
 His idea was that I should travel in.

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:30.600
 The compartment alongside his but it was bought the

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.800
 only place I could get was number 16,

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.400
 but I figured it was in a good strategic position.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.200
 The only way a killer could come was through the rear

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.600
 end or to the platform.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.900
 He would have to pass right by my compartment.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.900
 Did he give you any idea why his life was being threatened?

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.800
 No, you just said someone was out for his blood.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.600
 You knew who he really was.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.000
 Of course you recognized him.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.500
 I don't get you.

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:59.900
 Ratchet was cassetti the Armstrong kidnapper cassetti

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.200
 know.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:01.500
 Mr.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.100
 Poirot.

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:06.100
 I didn't know I was Way Out West at the time of the kidnapping

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.200
 I suppose.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.200
 I must have seen photographs of him in the papers,

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.500
 but I wouldn't recognize my own mother when a press

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.100
 photographer down with her very true.

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:14.400
 Mr.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:14.900
 Hardman.

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.500
 Hmm not surprised.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.900
 Someone had it in for Ratchet.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.900
 Did he give you any clue as to the identity of the person

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:21.800
 who was threatening him?

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.300
 Well, I know what he looked like,

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:24.800
 mr.

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.200
 She described him to me.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.700
 He described him.

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:30.500
 Yeah, he told me to be on the lookout for a small man

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.700
 dark with a high-pitched womanish kind of voice a

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.400
 small dark man,

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.900
 and he said he didn't think that he would strike on

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:41.300
 the first night out a small dark man with a woman.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:42.100
 He's voice.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.300
 That's the way you describe them.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:44.500
 Thank you.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:44.800
 Mr.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.400
 Hardeman.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.000
 You have been of great assistance to us.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.400
 It's good to know that mr.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.900
 Poirot if there is anything at all,

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.800
 I can do don't hesitate to ask me.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.400
 You know where to find me.

01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:01.000
 At little dog man with a high pitch voice.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.100
 There is no one on the train even remotely like that.

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:06.700
 Exactly.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.600
 So all our calculations are wrong.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.800
 We shall have to go back to the beginning at so my friend.

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.500
 I have an idea that this little man with a woman's voice

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:19.100
 is someone we are going to meet again,

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.400
 but who can he possibly be the first time I begin to

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.200
 have a glimpse of what may have happened last night?

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.500
 The little man who could not have been on the train

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.400
 the mysterious lady in the red kimono who was in ratchets

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400
 compartment.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.600
 What about the pipe cleaner?

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:39.800
 The woman's handkerchief the watch that stopped

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:44.800
 so conveniently it is a very amusing little game that

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.500
 is being played for our benefit.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.500
 Within a very little time my friend I shall be able

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.100
 to tell you who committed the murder on the Orient

01:22:54.100 --> 01:23:00.300
 Express cure Poirot is not so easily fooled.

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.100
 So mr.

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.700
 Powell who the murderer is most probably a member

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:14.800
 of the Armstrong family.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.500
 Yes, dr.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.300
 Constantine.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.300
 It is a strong possibility,

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:21.000
 but we have found no direct connection with the family

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.900
 apart from the princess dragomiroff who in any case

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:26.000
 would not have had the strength to deliver such a fatal

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.300
 blow which of the passengers have we not yet interviewed

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:33.700
 about Princess dragomiroff made Hildegard Schmidt

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.800
 Miss debenham who seems to interest you so much and

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.900
 the Italian for scarily I think.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.400
 Should interview the Italian very well Monsieur

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.300
 book, since you are convinced that this is the kind

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.600
 of mother that only an excitable Latin could have

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.400
 committed.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.000
 Let us get it over with and talk to signor foscarelli.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:54.200
 Of course,

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.700
 I have been in America many many times.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.100
 You see I am an agent for default the cars.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.800
 So naturally I go to America.

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:04.600
 It was there that I discovered my natural genius for

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.900
 salesmanship Earnest Potter.

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:07.900
 You battle heard of him.

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.300
 He is very big in Detroit.

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.000
 He says it to be fast.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.700
 Can I really say in all my born days in your manager

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.200
 needs to the United States.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.100
 Did you ever meet the murdered man?

01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:18.400
 Mr.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.600
 Ratchett never but I know the type very respectable

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:23.200
 very well.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.100
 Rest, but Underneath It All something is wrong out

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.100
 of my experience.

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.900
 I should say he is a crook.

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.100
 I give you my opinion for what it is worth.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:32.900
 You are quite right.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.000
 All right,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.400
 it was cassetti the kidnapper.

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:37.800
 What did I tell you?

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:41.400
 You remember the Armstrong case my do not quite remember

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.300
 it was a little girl.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.000
 Who was it not?

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.500
 a terrible thing

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.200
 but even in a great civilization like America,

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:54.300
 did you ever come across any members of the Armstrong

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:54.800
 family?

01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.600
 I come across so many people in a week.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.200
 I sell 20 or 30 cars which means that least a 30 or 40

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:01.700
 people.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.500
 I cannot remember every single one now tell me if you

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.800
 please you are exact movements last night from dinner

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.100
 on words with pleasure.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.100
 I stay here in the dining car.

01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:14.300
 As long as I can I talk to the American gentleman at

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:15.200
 my table and mr.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:15.700
 Hardman.

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.500
 That's right.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.400
 He sells a typewriter.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.700
 It's just imagine as I go back to my compartment.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.700
 It is empty the immeasurable English servant who

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.800
 shared it with me as a way attending his master the

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.400
 kidnapper at last he comes back pulling a long face

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.200
 as usual.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.700
 He will not to talk simply says yes,

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:37.500
 and no and miserable tasty English.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.500
 He sits in the coordinate very stiff and it's a woman's

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.600
 novel then the conductor comes and makes our bed.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.700
 But which was your birth the one on the top I get up there

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.400
 I smoke.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.900
 I read the little Englishman has I think of the toothache

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.700
 he gets out a bottle of stuff that's motive fairies

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.500
 from presently.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.000
 I sleep whenever I wake I hear him groaning.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
 Do you know if he'd have the compartment during the

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.500
 night?

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.400
 So I don't think so.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.200
 I would certainly have hurt him.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.300
 Did he ever speak of his master?

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:06.600
 Mr.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.500
 Ratchett, but he never speak of anything.

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.900
 He is not the same particle a fish.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.600
 Is that all for the time being?

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.500
 Yes, thank you signor foscarelli.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.500
 good day to you gentlemen

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:22.200
 Huh?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
 Well, my friend,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.800
 what do you think of your principal suspect?

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.100
 I don't like him.

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.900
 He's a big mouth perhaps but that does not make him

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:34.600
 a murderer.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:38.000
 I do not think this is a Latin Crime of Passion,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.900
 which is true fast cited.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:44.800
 It is a crime that shows traces of a cool resourceful

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.500
 deliberate brain.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.100
 I think an Anglo-Saxon brain

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.300
 Perhaps it is time that we saw the English Governors

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:54.100
 Miss.

01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:54.900
 Debenham.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.700
 I'm afraid I have nothing at all to tell you.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.500
 I simply went to bed and slept does it distress you

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.500
 very much man myself that crime should have been committed

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:05.300
 on this train.

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.000
 I haven't really thought about it from that point

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:07.300
 of view.

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:08.600
 No, I can't say that.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.800
 I'm at all distressed.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.600
 You are very Act of sex and now you're not.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:12.900
 Mr.

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:15.700
 Burnham, you do not make a show the emotions.

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.100
 I don't see why I should put on a fit of hysterics to

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:21.400
 prove my sensibility after all people die every day

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:21.900
 they die.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:22.600
 Yes.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.100
 But murder is little more than usual.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.300
 Where are you acquainted with the dead man?

01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:32.700
 I saw him for the first time when taking lunch in here

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:33.400
 yesterday.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.800
 And how did he strike you I hardly noticed him.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.600
 Did he impress you as an evil personality?

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.900
 I can't really say that I thought about it.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.400
 You are I think a little contemptuous of the way I go

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.600
 about my inquiries.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:51.000
 This is not the way it would be conducted in England.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.300
 You think seems a complete waste of time whether or

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:54.800
 not I like,

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.100
 mr.

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.300
 Ratchets features does not seem to me likely.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.300
 Be helpful in finding out who killed him.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.600
 Do you know who this?

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:00.900
 Mr.

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.200
 Ratchett who really was mrs.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:06.200
 Hubbard has been telling everybody and what do you

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.800
 think of the Armstrong Affair?

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.700
 It's quite abominable disgusting attend.

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:14.900
 The event was a do you intend to return to Baghdad after

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:16.200
 your holiday in England?

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:19.600
 I'm not sure why is that Baghdad is rather out of things.

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.500
 I think I should prefer a post in London if I hear of

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.000
 a suitable wanna see now,

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.300
 I thought perhaps you might be going to get married.

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.200
 I don't think that's any of your business tell me.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.000
 What is your opinion of the lady?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.800
 Who shares your compartment Miss Olson.

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.200
 She seems a pleasant simple creature.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.500
 What color is her dressing gown kind of brownish color

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.700
 natural water your own pale move.

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.300
 You do not have a sterile dressing on for example.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.200
 No, that is not mine.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:48.700
 Who's then?

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.100
 How should I know?

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.400
 Are you said that?

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.700
 It's not mine implying that such a thing does belong

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:55.500
 to someone else.

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:56.300
 Yes, sir.

01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:57.300
 Who's this?

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.600
 It I don't know.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.200
 I woke up this morning at 5 o'clock with a feeling train

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.100
 had been standing still for a long time.

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.700
 I opened the door and looked out into the corridor

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.300
 was thinking we might be in a station.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.300
 I saw someone in a Scarlet kimono some way down the

01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:14.400
 corridor and do you have any idea who it was was she

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.800
 fair or dark?

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.100
 I can't say she was wearing a shingle cap.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.600
 And I only saw the back of her head and her build tallish

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.800
 and slim I should judge but it's difficult to say the

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.200
 commander was embroidered with dragons dragons.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.700
 It's just so will that be all?

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:33.400
 His I need to know to keep your father man was hell then

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.500
 I shall return to my compartment.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:36.700
 Thank you.

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.500
 I do not quite understand my friend.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.500
 What were you trying to do?

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.300
 I was looking for a flow a flow.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:48.600
 Yes in the armor of that young lady said position.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.600
 I wanted to shake her some flour and I succeed I do not

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.800
 know but why should you wish to do that?

01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:59.700
 Maybe if she seems a Charming young lady the last person

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.300
 in the world to be involved in a crime of this guy you

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:07.100
 must both of you rid yourselves of the obsession that

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:07.800
 this is a

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.700
 And premeditated crime I suspect.

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:11.000
 Mr.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.200
 Burnham for two reasons.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.500
 The first is that conversation I overheard from the

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:16.300
 Taurus Express.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:17.400
 You will remember me as your book.

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.600
 I told you that she was the words when it's all over

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.500
 when it's all behind us.

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:26.200
 But that doesn't make her a murderous.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.200
 It could have meant to anything.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.000
 What is your other reason because she has just the

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.100
 kind of cool intelligent resourceful brain to have

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:36.000
 planned this crime.

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.400
 I'm sure you are.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.100
 Pletely roll my friend.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.500
 She's certainly not the criminal type.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.900
 I will let us talk to the final name on a list.

01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:47.400
 The princess is made here the couch mate.

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.700
 Could you ask be a Michelle to get her?

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:53.300
 Oh, no,

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.100
 there was nothing unusual about the princess sending

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.500
 for me during the night.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:00.300
 She sleeps badly and sometimes she is in pain.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.900
 And what time would this have been I do not know Missy.

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:06.200
 I was asleep the attendant came to wake me who got up

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.000
 and put on your red dressing gown.

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:11.000
 What makes you think I have a red dressing gong not

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.600
 in stock blue in any case Her Excellency would not

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.700
 have liked me to attend her in my dressing gown.

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:18.300
 I put on my clothes.

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:20.000
 You must forgive my little joke.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.900
 And what did you do when you got there?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.800
 I messaged her neck and shoulders and I read aloud

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.000
 to her for a little while,

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.400
 but it was very cold in spite of the heating event to

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.600
 get the princess of rock from my compartment.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:37.600
 I put it over her border out a little mineral water

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:40.900
 turned out the light and return to my own compartment.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.800
 Did you meet anyone who recorded a divorce the conduct?

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.500
 Of course,

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:45.400
 what was he doing?

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.300
 He came out of one of the compartments miss you.

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.900
 Which one can you tell us?

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.900
 It was about the middle of the

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:55.200
 Monsieur two or three doors down from Madame de France's

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:56.500
 he nearly ran into me.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.500
 When was this when I was returning from a compartment

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.700
 with the right magic came out of the compartment and

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:05.000
 collided with you in which direction was you going

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.200
 towards the dining car Mister a bill began ringing

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.400
 but I do not think he went to answer it.

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.600
 Oh the poor conductor must have had a heavy night first

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.300
 waking you and then running about answering bells.

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:16.900
 Oh, no,

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.100
 it was not the same conductor as the one who woke me.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.900
 It was another one had

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
 You seen him before?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:23.700
 No, miss you.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.800
 Do you think you could recognize him again?

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:26.700
 I think so.

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.600
 I think we should have all the conductors in here at

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:29.900
 once.

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:30.500
 I agree.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.700
 If you would be so kind as you will get I will see to its

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.200
 lately.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.800
 Have you ever been in America for lunch meat never

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:42.000
 missed you you have already heard perhaps who the

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.600
 married man already was?

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:43.900
 Yes.

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:47.300
 I have heard the good God should not allow such things.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:51.300
 But he has seen that Justice is done to me is

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.900
 This your handkerchief Robin Schmidt.

01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:56.800
 It has the letter H.

01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:00.500
 You see that is a lady's handkerchief a very expensive

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:00.800
 one.

01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:02.300
 It is hand-embroidered.

01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:03.300
 It comes from Paris.

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.500
 I imagine do you perhaps know whose it is?

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.800
 I know miss you buddy.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:10.700
 See you come this way miss you.

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:16.200
 These are the three sleeping car conductors for lunch

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200
 meat now,

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.400
 will you be so kind as to tell us which is the one you

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.000
 met last night when you were going with

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:25.600
 Rug to the princess there must be some mistake.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:26.700
 What do you mean?

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.500
 None of these men's the conduct I saw last night,

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.700
 but these are the only conductors on the train.

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.500
 These are Big Tall Men.

01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.400
 The man I saw last night was small and very dark.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:40.400
 He had a little mustache and he had a high little weak

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.700
 voice almost like a woman's I am certain of it.

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.400
 Surely someone must get here soon.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.900
 They can't just leave us marooned out here forever.

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.900
 I said that we should hear again about this small dark

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:01.000
 man with a woman whose voice it is the personal ratchet

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.600
 told hard man to be on the lookout for mrs.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.800
 Hubbard found a wagon D button in her room.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.300
 But if this man exists,

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:10.800
 where is he now every part of the train has been searched

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.600
 most fully then he can only be a passenger on the train

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.700
 or in Disguise.

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:15.700
 There is no man of this.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.300
 Size or shape on the train?

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.500
 So we have two mysterious strangers the wagonlit

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.700
 conductor and the woman in the red kimono,

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.200
 who are these two people and incidentally,

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.500
 where are the vagary uniform and the red kimono we

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.500
 must search the passengers luggage,

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.200
 they won't like it,

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.300
 but I don't see that.

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:35.200
 We have any alternative.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:35.800
 All right,

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.200
 but I will make a prophecy.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:40.300
 You know,

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:41.100
 where they are.

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.300
 You will find the Scarlet kimono in the baggage of

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:45.400
 one of the men.

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.700
 And you will find the wreck only uniform in a suitcase

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:50.700
 belonging to Hildegard Schmidt,

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:54.000
 but she struck me as being an utterly harmless person

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.100
 and my friend that is not what I meant.

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.500
 If he look out Schmidt is guilty the uniform might

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:00.500
 be found in her baggage.

01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.100
 But if she is innocent,

01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:08.700
 it's certainly will be what on Earth is going on.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.200
 Just do it.

01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:21.700
 It's in my sponge bag.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.100
 What about your sponge bag?

01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:23.400
 Madam?

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.700
 What is it?

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:25.900
 It's tough.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.400
 I think perhaps Monsieur book.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.000
 If you were to give me the Sabbath a little Kanye waited.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:30.200
 Yes.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.900
 I'm a lifelong teetotaler.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.900
 I never touched the nevertheless Madam you have obviously

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:36.300
 had a great shock and I figured

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.500
 If it's strictly Medical,

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.600
 but of course ma'am,

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.000
 of course good.

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.600
 I shall go and inspect the dirty sponge bag.

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:47.400
 I would be grateful if you would accompany me doctor

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.900
 constant, but what about mrs.

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:52.400
 Hubbard or cognac will work wonders and I think it

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.000
 is most important for you to come with me very well.

01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:57.100
 Not too much fun.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:58.800
 Only a little drop.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.800
 It is as I expected.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.300
 Dr.

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.800
 Take a close look at it.

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:07.900
 Could it be the murder weapon a straight-bladed dagger

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:10.400
 stained as you see with blood?

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:13.100
 It is almost certainly that I got which was used to

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.100
 kill ratchet.

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.500
 It could account for almost any of the wounds.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:20.700
 So the sponge bag was hanging on the door handle.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.100
 Hmm.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.500
 How curious we locked the door from the other side

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:31.700
 you remember is that is true it agree is does it not

01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:36.000
 the mother of passes through this courage as he shuts

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.500
 the communicating door behind him.

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:41.600
 He feels the sponge bag and he slips the dagger inside

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.300
 it then he goes out through the other door into the

01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:49.800
 Cordon is that just how it must have happened and yet

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:50.600
 mrs.

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:53.700
 Hubbard said she could not see the boat because of

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:54.000
 this.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.100
 Punch back.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.200
 I got possibly spend another night in that compartment.

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.100
 I'd rather sleep in the corridor it my daughter could

01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:01.900
 see me now.

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.800
 He'd be no one could possibly allow you to spend another

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.100
 night.

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:07.600
 Then your baggage should be taken immediately to

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:10.200
 another compartment in the Belgrade coach.

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.000
 One moment.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
 If you please there is a little matter of routine you

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.600
 permit Madame that I make a search of your baggage

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.500
 whatever for we are about to carry out an inspection

01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.400
 of all the passengers luggage.

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.900
 I do not need to remind you of your

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:28.200
 Recent most unpleasant experience your sponge back

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:32.100
 messy honest don't let me stop you Monsieur Poirot.

01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:35.600
 I just couldn't stand another shot like that.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:39.400
 Go ahead Search Everything.

01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:44.800
 This may well be a complete waste of time and effort

01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.100
 nothing in mrs.

01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:46.900
 Habits luggage.

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:49.500
 Nothing in Hartman's nothing in the princess dragomir

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:49.800
 office.

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.800
 And as for Colonel arbuthnot,

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.800
 so pipe cleaners which were identical with the one

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.000
 we found on the floor of righteous compartment,

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.200
 but it is not in the Colonel's character to commit

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.500
 a murder in that fashion.

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:04.600
 And when you have said that you have said everything

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:09.400
 so who is next the content contestant Ranger who that

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.100
 may be extremely awkward.

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.500
 Behold diplomatic passports their luggage is exempt

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.200
 from examination by the Customs.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.200
 Yes, but a murder inquiry has different Elders saying

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:23.600
 we don't wish to cause complications do not distress

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.700
 yourself my friend.

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.700
 It will not cause trouble for the company.

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:30.500
 They've only the content contest will be reasonable

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:32.200
 at any rate.

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.000
 Let us make an attempt.

01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:38.400
 Andre

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.800
 I don't miss you in a cone Madame La comtesse pray forgive

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.700
 this intrusion.

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:51.200
 It is necessary for us to make a search of all the package

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.400
 on this train in most cases.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.700
 It is a mere formality,

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:56.600
 but I am afraid that it has to be done.

01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.600
 Monsieur book has suggested that as you hold a diplomatic

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.400
 passport.

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:03.100
 You may reasonably claim to be exempt from such as

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:03.700
 a tree.

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:06.200
 It is very considerate of you Monsieur book,

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.000
 but I don't think that I care for an exception to be

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.300
 made in my case Monsieur Le comte is moose.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.400
 It's accommodating.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.300
 I should prefer that our baggage be examined like

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:18.700
 that of the other passengers you do not object.

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.600
 I hope Elena not at all.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:21.700
 Go ahead.

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.200
 Thank you Madame La comtesse.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.900
 This is your suitcase.

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:26.300
 Yes.

01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:26.800
 It is.

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:30.700
 Oh ha ha ha the label on it is wet.

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.700
 It must be something to do with the condensation.

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:37.200
 What else can you expect with snow on every side?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.900
 It is a mere formality man myself,

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:45.800
 but nevertheless it is necessary with your permission.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.100
 Mr.

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:46.500
 Burnham.

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:47.800
 Oh, go ahead.

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.200
 Here are the keys you are most understanding Miss

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:51.800
 Olsen.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.400
 Oh, yes,

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.000
 of course,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.400
 if you say is necessary.

01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:57.800
 You have become a good friend of mrs.

01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:58.200
 Hubbard.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:58.900
 Have you not?

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:02.000
 Yes, we have moved her into another compartment in

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
 the next coach,

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.800
 but she's still very upset as a consequence of fainting

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:07.500
 the dagger in her sponge bag.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.200
 I have ordered coffee twister.

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:09.600
 To her,

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.300
 but I think she needs someone to talk to.

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.400
 Oh poor lady.

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.000
 Of course.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.900
 I will go to her.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.500
 It must have been terrible shock.

01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:19.900
 I would take some smelling salts.

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:21.300
 They are there.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.600
 Could you pass them?

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.500
 Are you my members?

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:27.700
 And thank you my case is not enough.

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.600
 Why did you send her away?

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.800
 No, I do not understand you missed every time you wanted

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.800
 to get me alone wasn't that it man was we have a proverb

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.600
 icky 6qs suck use is that what you're going to say?

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.900
 You must give me credit for a certain amount of observation

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:48.100
 and Common Sense for some reason or other.

01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:50.200
 You've got it into your head that I know something

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.300
 about this sordid business.

01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.000
 This is your suitcase.

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:55.300
 Yes it is.

01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:00.600
 But I will not beat about the bush eyeshadows you to

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.000
 tell me the meaning of certain words.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.700
 I heard her speak when you and Colonel arbuthnot got

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.300
 out of the tourist Express to stretch the legs as you

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:08.400
 call it at chania.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.500
 You said to him not now when it's all over when it's

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:13.200
 behind us.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.000
 What did you mean by those words?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:15.300
 Mr.

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:15.600
 Burnham?

01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.300
 You think I meant murder?

01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:20.900
 She's I'll I'm asking you there's words had a meaning

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.500
 but not one that I can tell you.

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.900
 I can only give you my solemn word of Honor that I have

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:26.900
 never set eyes on this.

01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:30.300
 Man ratchet in my life until I saw him on the street

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.800
 and you refuse to explain those words.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.100
 If you like to put it that way words were private they

01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:40.900
 had to do with a task that had undertaken a task that

01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.100
 is now ended.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.600
 What do you mean to send it?

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:46.100
 Is it not why should you think so let me record you to

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:46.900
 another incident.

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:48.700
 There was a delay to the Train on the day.

01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:52.200
 We were due to reach us some bull you normally so calm

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.600
 so self-controlled.

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.100
 We're very agitated.

01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:56.900
 I didn't want to miss my connection to Orange.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.800
 Express runs every day of the week.

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.000
 Why was it so important to be on this particular train?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.100
 You don't seem to realize that one may have friends

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:06.600
 awaiting ones arrival in London that a day's delay

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.400
 upsets arrangements and causes a lot of annoyance

01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.600
 know just like that yet.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.800
 Now when we are trapped here in snow,

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.100
 your manner is quite different.

01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:18.700
 You are calm philosophical almost.

01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:21.900
 You do not answer my question.

01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:24.600
 Don't you think you're making rather a fuss about

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.400
 nothing Monsieur Poirot who dis perhaps a fault with

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.300
 us detectives.

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:31.000
 We expect the behavior to be always consistent.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.700
 Have you finished examining my luggage?

01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:33.200
 Oh, thank you.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.300
 Yes, you still refuse to tell me the meaning of those

01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.600
 words when it's behind us.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.700
 I have nothing more to say.

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:44.500
 It does not matter.

01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:47.200
 I shall find out.

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:49.800
 Good day miss Devlin.

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.100
 And I found nothing in the McQueen's leg age or Master

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:59.200
 man's office Kelly's which leaves us only with Fraulein

01:42:59.200 --> 01:42:59.800
 Schmidt.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.100
 Yes, miss you have forgive us disturbing new fallen

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:07.500
 Schmidt.

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.200
 But we are making a search of the passengers luggage,

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.500
 of course coming.

01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.700
 Perhaps we could start with the suitcase on the rack

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:19.000
 as you wish I will get it done.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.500
 And do you have the keys for arrangement?

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:27.100
 It is not locked to leave a got what honest is that doing

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:27.500
 there?

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:30.400
 You remember my little prophecy must you book the

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.300
 Vagabonds the universe but that is not mine.

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:34.400
 I did not put it there.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.400
 I have not open that suitcase since we left.

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.200
 You stumble not be agitated.

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.500
 We believe you I am assure.

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.000
 You did not hide the uniform as I am sure you.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.600
 Good cook you are a good cook,

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.100
 I believe so all my ladies have said that that and half

01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:50.300
 of the uniform of God that I will tell you.

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:53.800
 What happened this man the man you saw in the Valley

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.900
 Uniform comes out of the Dead Man's compartment.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
 He collides with you.

01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.700
 And of course he had hoped that no one would see him.

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:04.600
 He must get rid of the uniform he watches you going

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.700
 to the princesses compartment and he knows that yours

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:08.400
 will be empty.

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.400
 He slips in removes the uniform and put it into your

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:12.900
 suitcase.

01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:15.600
 Yes, that is how it must have happened.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.400
 And then that we have to find out you see here.

01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:22.700
 The button is missing the button that was found in

01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:23.100
 mrs.

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:26.700
 Habits compartment and in the pocket a conductor

01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:31.100
 spassky here is the explanation of how a man was able

01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:34.600
 to go through lock doors with this key could go anywhere.

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:40.000
 Mmm one mystery Remains The Scarlet kimono.

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.000
 We have not found it.

01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:43.000
 Hey it is it.

01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.500
 The mystery haha.

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:47.100
 Well there is nothing more to be found here at any rate.

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.900
 Thank you for lunch meat and do not worry yourself.

01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:53.100
 I do not see how I can help it miss you.

01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:57.900
 We may as well go back to the dining car.

01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.500
 We know now all that.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:02.300
 We can know we have the evidence of the passengers

01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:06.500
 the evidence of our eyes we need now to turn over all

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:12.500
 these facts and our brains to use our little gray cells.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:14.600
 Perhaps you might ask.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.000
 Dr.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.400
 Constant type of join us.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:19.800
 He's you think it necessary most certainly I will

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:20.600
 be with you in a moment.

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.900
 I am I need the cigarettes from my compartment.

01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:32.100
 Someone appears to be taking an interest in us at last

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.500
 and army aircraft.

01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:41.000
 Well, that should make him take notice of us is dipping

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:41.600
 his wings.

01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:50.800
 Well, at least they know that we are here it makes it

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.400
 even more urgent to clear up this business before

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.000
 the police arrived ha.

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:55.300
 Mr.

01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:58.500
 Poirot you cannot imagine what I found in my compartment.

01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:03.000
 Neatly folded up on top of my suitcase a Scarlet kimono

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.900
 embroidered with Dragons.

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:05.900
 Hmm.

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:11.800
 It is a challenge a defense and Hercule Poirot will

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:12.800
 take it up.

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.100
 But where on Earth does one start we found nothing

01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:16.600
 in the passengers luggage that we

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.900
 Not intended to find and as for the evidence,

01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:21.500
 he told us nothing at all.

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.100
 Yes.

01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:24.400
 There were one or two points of interests my way.

01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:25.600
 I didn't notice anything.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.000
 Do you remember for instance?

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:27.400
 What Young?

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:27.700
 Mr.

01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:29.300
 McQueen said about his employer?

01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:29.600
 Mr.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.100
 Ratchett.

01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.600
 He was hampered by knowing no languages.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.400
 We will do it.

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.100
 You do not see when the conductor Michele answered.

01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:37.300
 Mr.

01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:40.900
 Ratchett spell didn't ratchet reply to him in French

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:41.700
 Bravo doctor.

01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:44.100
 He said sneer hanegem Sweet Home.

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.600
 I Heard a Voice myself you

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:49.300
 Heard the voice but you mean it may not have been that

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:52.900
 of Ratchet ha now I understand your reluctance to

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:55.900
 accept the evidence of the broken watch already at

01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:59.400
 23 minutes to one ratchet was dead and the voice you

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:00.600
 heard was that of his murder.

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:00.900
 No, no.

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:04.500
 No, let us not go too fast and do not let us assume more

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:08.900
 than we know let us approach the case from an entirely

01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:09.800
 different angle.

01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:14.600
 How was the murderer intended to appear to everybody?

01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:16.600
 You mean if we had not run into

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:18.200
 Snowed exactly doctor,

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.400
 the murder would probably not have been discovered

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:23.100
 until we reach the Italian front here which would

01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.400
 have been early this morning,

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.800
 but for the snow and the evidence would have been given

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.000
 to the Italian police.

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:28.700
 Mr.

01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:31.200
 McQueen would have produced the threatening letters.

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:31.900
 Mr.

01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:34.200
 Hardman would have told them that wretched told him

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:36.500
 to be on the lookout for a little man with a high-pitched

01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:37.000
 voice.

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:37.700
 Mrs.

01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:39.900
 Hubbard would have been eager to tell how the murderer

01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:41.600
 had been in her compartment.

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:45.200
 The button would have been found you mean that the

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.600
 murder was planned to look.

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:48.300
 I can outside job exactly.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.800
 What time was the train scheduled to arrive at Broad

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:54.100
 at two minutes to 1:00 in the morning than the Assassin

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.900
 would have been presumed to have got off the train

01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:56.600
 at Broad.

01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.200
 Somebody would probably have noticed a strange little

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:01.400
 rag on the conductor passing down the corridor.

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:04.500
 No suspicion would have been attached to any of the

01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:05.300
 passengers.

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:08.700
 The murderer would have been the man hard man had been

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:11.500
 told to look for but where does all this get us?

01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:13.700
 We are no nearer to finding the killers.

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:14.900
 Oh, no.

01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:17.800
 We are very close.

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.300
 Now.

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.400
 We must first distinguish between the clues which

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.600
 were deliberately planted for us to find and those

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.100
 which were not the pipe cleaner and the button were

01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:31.000
 part of a little Sherrod but the handkerchief and

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.100
 the burnt letter we're not but why was the letter written

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:35.100
 in the first place?

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.200
 You have perhaps read the novel of Robert Louis Stevenson

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:41.900
 Treasure Island when I was a child you remember the

01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:45.700
 black spot and notice of execution a warning.

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:48.500
 To death sentence had been passed and the letter was

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:50.900
 destroyed so that no one would connect the killing

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:52.000
 with the Armstrong family,

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.600
 but we have been over all this before and with the exception

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.500
 of the process diagram of there is no one even remotely

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.300
 connected with the Armstrong family.

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.800
 That is what we are intended to believe but the evidence

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.600
 of the handkerchief may prove.

01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:09.100
 Otherwise Patchouli since that person knows that

01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:10.300
 we have the handkerchief.

01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:13.700
 She would do anything in her power to conceal her name.

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:14.100
 Haha.

01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:15.700
 You would make quite a

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:20.400
 Patent detective doctor and there is one person on

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:25.800
 this train who has done just that but tell us please

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.000
 please no,

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:30.300
 you must preserve your patience until after dinner

01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:30.900
 my friends.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
 I have observed that she is always the last person

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.100
 to leave the dining car.

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.400
 Did any car I'm with you.

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:39.200
 Thank goodness.

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:40.200
 You have reminded me.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.700
 I must talk to the chef.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:44.800
 No Madam,

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.600
 I think you have dropped your handkerchief.

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:48.800
 You are mistaken.

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:51.500
 Miss you is that is not my handkerchief.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.100
 Are you sure of that man?

01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.300
 I'm a contest perfectly sure and you had to test your

01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:58.600
 initial the letter H.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:01.600
 I do not understand you miss you.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.900
 My initials are EA.

01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:06.500
 I think you are not telling me the truth.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.200
 How dare you that was why you concealed you read initials

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.400
 on your passport with a spot of Grease?

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.700
 And why you covered your initials on your suitcase

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:19.000
 with a new label a label which was still wet.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.700
 When I examined your luggage.

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.100
 Your name is Helena,

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:24.500
 not Elena.

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:29.400
 You are Helena Goldenberg the younger daughter of

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.800
 Linda Arden Helena Goldenberg the sister of Sonia

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:38.400
 Armstrong who's child the dead man,

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:42.000
 ratchet kidnapped and murdered.

01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:45.100
 It is useless to the night Madam.

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:48.600
 You are Helena Goldenberg the sister of Sonia Armstrong.

01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:49.900
 I'm not denying it.

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:50.900
 Yes.

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:52.100
 I am Sonia sister.

01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:54.300
 You did not acquaint me with that fact when I questioned

01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.600
 you earlier than a contest.

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.400
 So I did not in fact everything that you and your husband

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.200
 have told me was at issue of life.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:01.200
 So I cannot allow,

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:04.300
 you know speed off Monsieur Poirot puts the facts

01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:05.200
 rather brutally,

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.100
 but what he says is undeniable,

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:10.600
 I'm glad you admit to facto Freedom Adam we do now tell

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.800
 me your reasons for doing so and for obscure.

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:14.700
 Your Christian name on your passport.

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:18.100
 That was my doing entirely surely Monsieur Poirot.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:21.700
 You can guess my reason the man who was killed is the

01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:24.900
 man who murdered my baby niece who killed my sister

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.500
 who broke my brother-in-law's heart of all the people

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.200
 on this train.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.300
 I alone had the best motive for killing him.

01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:32.700
 And did you kill him at him?

01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:36.700
 I swear to you Monsieur Poirot that much as I may have

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:37.700
 been tempted to it.

01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.600
 I never lifted a hand against the man.

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.700
 I do I give you my word of Honor that last night.

01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:44.900
 Elena never left her compartment.

01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:46.500
 She took a sleeping pill exactly.

01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:51.100
 As I said she is totally innocent then how do you explain

01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:53.300
 the presence of your wife's hand kerchief in the Dead

01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:55.800
 Man's compartment that handkerchief is not mine

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:58.800
 in spite of the initial H in spite of the initial but

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.000
 after so many lies,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.100
 how can I know that you are telling me the truth?

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.600
 I know that I cannot hope to make you believe me,

01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:08.700
 but I assure you that it is so the handkerchief is not

01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:09.400
 mine then.

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:12.100
 Why did you alter the name on your passport course?

01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:12.700
 We heard that.

01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:15.400
 Uncle Chief had been found with the initial h on it.

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:17.900
 I couldn't bear the thought of having the kidnapping

01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:20.800
 raked up again and to be suspected and perhaps thrown

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:21.600
 into prison.

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:25.700
 I was scared stiff Monsieur Poirot can't you understand

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:28.400
 if I am inclined to believe you're mad and then you

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.600
 must help me help you.

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:35.200
 Yes, the reason for the murder lies in the past in that

01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:37.500
 tragedy which broke up your home and destroy your

01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:42.600
 young life take me back into the past that I may find.

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.900
 They're the link that will explain the whole thing

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.200
 that what can there be to tell you there was another

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.600
 victim matter and indirect victim you might say or

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.800
 Suzanne the nursemaid.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:55.100
 Yes.

01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:56.300
 I have forgotten about her.

01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:58.800
 The police were convinced that she had something

01:52:58.800 --> 01:52:59.600
 to do with it.

01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:01.900
 She thought she was being held responsible.

01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:04.600
 She threw herself out of the window.

01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:05.800
 It was horrible.

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.500
 There was a nurse to I think yes,

01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:11.600
 there was I think her name was strangle Bert something

01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:12.100
 like that.

01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:16.000
 Devoted to Daisy and to my sister you were a younger

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:16.700
 at the time.

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:19.300
 Did you have known to superintend your studies?

01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:19.700
 Oh, yes.

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:22.300
 I had a governess a redhead Scotch woman.

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:23.800
 She was a fight for Dragon.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:24.700
 What was her name?

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:25.600
 Miss everybody,

01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:30.700
 huh young or old she seemed frightfully old to me.

01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:33.500
 I suppose she couldn't have been more than 40 and there

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.900
 were no other inmates in the house.

01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:38.600
 Only the servant the ascertain quite certain Madam

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:40.400
 that you have a recognized.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:41.600
 No one on the train.

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:42.700
 No.

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.700
 No one miss you.

01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:45.300
 No one at all.

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:54.900
 Did you hear that that is coming from the other side

01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:58.800
 of the barrier of snow ice Q is on its way me the me,

01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:01.300
 which means that the Yugoslav police will be on their

01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.900
 way to you are quite right doctor.

01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:04.300
 There is no time to be lost.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.100
 How long do you think it will take the snow plows to

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.400
 get through to us must you become a matter of hours.

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:09.900
 The princess is coming,

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:10.200
 huh?

01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:14.700
 Oh, pray be seated gentlemen.

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:17.500
 Monsieur Poirot,

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:22.200
 I believed that you have a handkerchief of mine.

01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:24.200
 Is this it Madam?

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:25.600
 Yes, it is.

01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:28.300
 It has my initial in the corner.

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:31.500
 But Madame LeBrun says it is the letter H.

01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:34.500
 I understood that your name was Natalia.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.400
 That is correct miss you,

01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:40.000
 but I think your tips are always in usually the Russian

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.700
 characters H is n in Russia,

01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:45.200
 but you did not tell me that the handkerchief was yours

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.200
 when we talked earlier.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.300
 You need not to make it link the business of this miss

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:50.600
 you.

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:54.200
 Your next question will be how did my handkerchief

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.500
 come to be lying next to the murdered man's body.

01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:02.900
 My reply is that I have no idea you will excuse me Madam,

01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:05.900
 but how much can we rely upon the truthfulness of your

01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:11.300
 replies is this because I did not tell you I knew that

01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:13.200
 Ellen and drain it was mrs.

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:14.400
 Armstrong sister.

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.600
 It was a deliberate lie madam.

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.300
 Of course it does her mother was my friend.

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:23.300
 I believe in loyalty to one's friends.

01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:26.500
 You want Stanley and two bombs gasps.

01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:29.000
 You do not believe in doing our utmost to further the

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.200
 cause of Justice.

01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:34.300
 No one paid much heed to the cause of Justice when cats

01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:34.600
 act.

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:37.200
 He walked from Zach Court a free man,

01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:45.000
 but now I believe that Justice a strict justice has

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:45.800
 been done.

01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:53.200
 Lies and still more lies.

01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:54.500
 It amazes me.

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.000
 The amount of Lies We had taught to us this morning.

01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.800
 There are still more to discover.

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.700
 So who do we tackle next week question the puck aside

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:06.000
 Colonel arbuthnot.

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:08.300
 I don't imagine he will be very pleased.

01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:13.000
 It could easily be one of my pipe cleaners.

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.100
 I don't put a private Markham.

01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:17.200
 Do you know where it was found not the least idea.

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.300
 It was found by the body of the murdered man.

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:22.500
 Can you tell us how he's likely to have got there if

01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.300
 you mean did I drop it there myself?

01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:25.300
 No, I didn't.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.200
 I never even spoke to the fella you mean you never spoke

01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:31.400
 to him and you did not murder him if I had I should have

01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:33.300
 the ability to acquaint you with the fact.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:35.100
 As a matter of fact,

01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:36.600
 I didn't murder ratchet now.

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.000
 Well, it is of no consequence.

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:41.800
 I beca punch is of no consequence what I really wish

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.800
 to ask you about was quite another matter.

01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:45.000
 Mr.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
 Burnham may have told you perhaps that I overheard

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:47.500
 some words.

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.600
 She spoke to you at the station of chania.

01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:54.300
 She said not now when it's all over when he told behind

01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:54.400
 us.

01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.300
 Can you tell us what she meant by that?

01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:56.900
 I'm sorry,

01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:58.700
 but I must refuse to answer that question.

01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:01.600
 You will not give away a lady secret you can put it that

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:01.800
 way.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:04.000
 If you like Miss debutante told me that the

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.200
 It's referred to a private matter of her own and why

01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:08.600
 not take her word for it?

01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:12.900
 Because Colonel Miss debenham is what one might call

01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:16.500
 a highly suspicious character that's nonsense.

01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:19.200
 You have nothing whatever against her not the fact

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:21.800
 that Miss Devon was companion governors in the Armstrong

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:24.000
 household at the time of the kidnapping of little

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.100
 Daisy Armstrong.

01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:28.800
 You see Colonel,

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:32.100
 we know more than you think if mr.

01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:33.100
 Burnham is innocent.

01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.100
 Why did she concealed the fact?

01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:38.200
 Why did she tell me that she had never been in America?

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:43.000
 Why don't you ask her that my dear Colonel is precisely

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.800
 what I am going to do.

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:47.500
 Yes, it's true.

01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:49.600
 I did lie to you.

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:52.900
 Ah, you admit it certainly since you found me out.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.300
 You are at least Frank than myself that doesn't seem

01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:58.300
 anything else for me to be and why did you lie to me?

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:01.100
 I should have thought the reason led to the MSU.

01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:03.000
 Apollo does not leap to mine.

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:06.200
 I have my living to get what has that to do with it.

01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.000
 What do you know the struggle to get and keep a decent

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:09.700
 situation.

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.500
 Do you think a woman who has been detained in connection

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.800
 with a murder case and whose photograph is probably

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.200
 appeared in all the English paper.

01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.800
 Do you think that any nice ordinary English middle-class

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.000
 woman would want to engage that person as a governess

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.200
 to her daughter's why should I put my whole future

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.400
 at risk when no good could have been served.

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:29.000
 I would have thought that I would have been the best

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:29.600
 judge of that.

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:34.200
 Not you you will not tell me your secret mademoiselle.

01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:36.200
 I can't.

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:41.600
 I can't you don't want me anymore.

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:45.500
 Do you miss your for how I shouldn't run away?

01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:52.400
 Another miracle has guess my dear friend.

01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:56.200
 You really are quite astonishing who I claim no credit

01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.600
 this time cancer center,

01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:01.000
 and he practically told me the woman that count this

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.400
 described as her governess was nothing like Miss.

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:03.900
 Debenham.

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:07.000
 She said she was a middle-aged Scott's woman with

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.900
 red hair the exact opposite in every respect and then

01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:13.700
 she had to invent a name for her on the spur of the moment

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:16.500
 and it was the unconscious Association of ideas that

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:17.900
 give her away she called

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.800
 Miss free body remember.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.300
 Yes in London.

01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:24.800
 There is a stock or Debenhams and free belly with an

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:26.600
 independent running in her head.

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.500
 She clutches at the first name that comes to mind Free

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.100
 Buddy, huh?

01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:33.800
 Nothing would surprise me.

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:37.200
 Now, even if everybody on the plane turned out to have

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:38.900
 been in the Armstrong have sold.

01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:41.000
 I should not so much as blink.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.900
 That is a very profound remark.

01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:46.100
 Would you like to see what your favorite suspect the

01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:48.200
 Italian has to say for himself?

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:53.900
 Yes, I was at the Armstrong the chauffeur but I had

01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.000
 a nothing to do with this business last night.

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:57.800
 I never left it the carriage.

01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:00.900
 You cannot prove anything against me very good.

02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:06.700
 You can go big should have gone to the electric chair.

02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:10.200
 Anyway, did you notice the American police and try

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:11.100
 to pin it on me?

02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:15.200
 But it was not you you had nothing to do with the kidnapping

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:16.000
 of the child.

02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:19.200
 Oh the nerd you could not understand.

02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:23.400
 That little girl was the light of the whole house Tanya.

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:24.200
 She called the me.

02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:27.600
 I'm a going to drive the cart now tono she would say

02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.400
 and she would sit on my lap and I hold the wheel.

02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:34.500
 How could anyone do such a thing to her?

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:37.300
 I do understand.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.800
 You may go she was an angel but a little bit.

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.600
 My head is spinning it is not possible.

02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.900
 Who are you going to Corner the Swedish lady Miss Olson,

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.900
 but how can she be involved in all these you remember

02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:01.800
 the train to nurse who worked with the Armstrong household?

02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:04.400
 That poor child.

02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:08.200
 She know nothing but kindness and love if you'd been

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:11.500
 there if you'd lived through that terrible tragedy.

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:15.000
 I know I should have told you the truth about myself,

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.600
 but I was afraid I was afraid because I Rejoice that

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.400
 that evil man was dead.

02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:22.900
 I understand everything.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.400
 I will ask you no more questions.

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:28.200
 Jeez enough that you have admitted what I knew to be

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:28.700
 the truth.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.100
 Go now made myself.

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:41.100
 A woman went beacons to understand how unutterably

02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:44.700
 evil this man must have been I hope I'm not intruding

02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:44.900
 sir.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:45.700
 Not in the least.

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:46.900
 What is it that you have to say?

02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:47.200
 Mr.

02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:47.800
 Masterman?

02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:50.500
 I thought it best to come along at once and tell you

02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:51.100
 the truth.

02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:52.100
 And what is that?

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.100
 I was Colonel Armstrong's Batman during the water

02:01:55.300 --> 02:01:58.300
 and afterwards I was his valid when the family was

02:01:58.300 --> 02:01:58.700
 living in,

02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:59.700
 New York.

02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.200
 I'm afraid I conceal the fact this morning.

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.000
 It was very wrong of miss her and I thought I'd better

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.800
 come along and make a clean breast of it very right

02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:08.200
 and proper.

02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:08.400
 Mr.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.100
 Masterman.

02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:10.500
 Is that all you have to say?

02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:11.500
 That is all sir.

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:12.300
 Thank you.

02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:13.600
 You may go.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.300
 I just had to get it off my conscience.

02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.500
 Have the 12 passengers in that coach nine have been

02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:24.800
 proved to have a connection with the Armstrong family.

02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.900
 But which of them is the murderer?

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:27.600
 Ah, my friend.

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:29.300
 I feel you do not understand at all.

02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:29.900
 Tell me.

02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:32.300
 Do you really not know who killed ratchet,

02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:35.900
 but do you how do you think that it is time now that we

02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:38.200
 assembled all the passengers together.

02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:41.600
 We'll ask Michele to arrange a yes Michelle.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.400
 It is essential that he is the true Messiah you mean

02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:48.100
 he too is involved in this or it is impossible.

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.300
 Will it all end?

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:56.200
 The passengers are all gathered in the dining car

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:57.000
 Mercy book.

02:02:57.300 --> 02:02:58.100
 Thank you Michelle.

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:00.400
 What's happening outside are getting up steam on

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:00.900
 the engine.

02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:02.200
 Does that mean the line is clear?

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.900
 The snow plows are only a few hundred meters away.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.600
 The track should be clear within the hour and the sooner.

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:10.000
 This little matter is cleared up the better if you

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.100
 would care to go ahead,

02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:11.800
 Monsieur Poirot.

02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:17.700
 Madame zema's sure

02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:22.500
 we are here as you know to investigate the killing

02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:25.900
 of Samuel Edward ratchet cassetti.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.400
 I have considered a matter very carefully and I have

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.000
 come to the conclusion that there are two possible

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.500
 explanations of the crime to I shall put both of them

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.800
 before you and I shall ask must your book and dr.

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:41.800
 Constantine here to judge.

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:44.800
 Which solution is the right one very well now.

02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:47.600
 You all know the facts of the case.

02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:49.200
 Mr.

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:51.000
 Ratchett was found stabbed this morning.

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:54.900
 He was last known to be alive at 12:37 last night when

02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:57.300
 he spoke to the back only conducted through the door

02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:00.300
 a watching his pajama pocket was found to be badly

02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:03.800
 dented and it had stopped at a quarter past one.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:06.600
 What did you consider the time of death to be able to

02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:07.400
 your examination?

02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:07.800
 Dr.

02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:11.200
 Between midnight and 2:00 in the morning at half an

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:13.800
 hour after midnight as you all know the train ran into

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:14.800
 a snowdrift.

02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:18.000
 By that time it was impossible for anyone to leave

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:18.500
 the train.

02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:20.900
 We are therefore forced to the conclusion that the

02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:23.900
 murderer is to be found among the occupants of one

02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:29.300
 particular coach the stumble Calla coach that as

02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:33.600
 I say was a theory what you mean miserable.

02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:38.300
 I will put before you an alternative Theory it is very

02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:39.000
 simple.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:40.400
 Mr.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:44.100
 Ratchett had a certain enemy whom he feared perhaps

02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:45.100
 you would describe him to us.

02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:45.300
 Mr.

02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:45.800
 Hardman.

02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:46.400
 Sure.

02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:49.600
 He said to look out for a small dark man with a woman

02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.800
 whose voice now.

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:51.900
 It is my belief that mr.

02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:55.300
 Ratchett new a good deal more than he told the enemy

02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:59.200
 as he expected joined the train at Belgrade or possibly

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.600
 have been cuffed see he wore a vagabond Lee uniform

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:05.600
 over his ordinary clothes and had a pass key which

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:07.100
 enabled him to gain access to mr.

02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.500
 Hedge its compartment the man.

02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:13.500
 Cab door at it with great ferocity and left through

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:15.100
 the communicating door to mrs.

02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:18.800
 Habits compartment and think that at first nobody

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.700
 would believe me.

02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:23.000
 He slipped out into the corridor put his uniform into

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.700
 Fraulein Schmidt suitcase and he left trained just

02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:29.400
 before he pulled out of him could see but what about

02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:33.500
 the watch there you have the explanation for the whole

02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:34.000
 thing.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:35.400
 Mr.

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:38.200
 Ratchett had omitted to put his watch back an hour

02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:39.400
 as he should have done it.

02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:43.200
 Are abroad his watch still registered Eastern European

02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:46.600
 time, which is one hour ahead of Central European

02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:47.100
 Time.

02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:52.000
 It was a quarter past 12:00 when ratchet was stabbed.

02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:54.700
 Not a quarter past one.

02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:55.300
 No, no.

02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:57.300
 No, this is not possible.

02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:00.300
 This explanation simply does not hold water.

02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:02.900
 It is deficient in at least a dozen points,

02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:03.600
 you know,

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:06.100
 very well that it is not the way in which the crime was

02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:06.500
 committed.

02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:06.800
 Mr.

02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:08.900
 Poirot very well doctor.

02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:13.100
 I see that I shall have to give you my second solution,

02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:17.400
 but do not abandon the first one to abruptly you may

02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:18.800
 come around to it later.

02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:23.500
 So we come to my second solution.

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:25.600
 First of all,

02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:28.600
 I was struck by a remark made by most your book in the

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:30.700
 restaurant kind of first day after leaving this town.

02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:33.600
 Would you mean about the company being so varied with

02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.000
 so many different characters and the nationality

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.500
 precisely when I was reflecting on the mother I tried.

02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:42.200
 To imagine whether such an assembly was ever likely

02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:44.700
 to be collected together under any other conditions

02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:49.200
 and the answer which came to me was only in America

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:50.600
 in America.

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:53.000
 That might be a household composed of just such very

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.100
 nationalities and Italian chauffeur and English

02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:59.800
 governess a Swedish nurse a French lady's maid and

02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:06.500
 so on that led to my little game of guessing casting

02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.900
 each person for a certain part in the Armstrong family

02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:09.400
 drama.

02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:14.100
 As a producer casts a play all your so-called guess

02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:16.700
 is turned out to be quite remarkably accurate is very

02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:20.300
 good of you to say so I then considered some of the evidence

02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:21.600
 that had been presented to us.

02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:23.400
 This is take.

02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:23.600
 Mr.

02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:24.400
 Masterman.

02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:27.100
 You said that your master was in the habit of taking

02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:30.100
 a sleeping Draft when traveling by train right there

02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:31.100
 is correct.

02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:34.500
 He invariably found it hard to get to sleep on a moving

02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:34.800
 train.

02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:38.400
 But Otto ratchet have taken one last night a man who

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.600
 keeps an automatic under his pillow because his life

02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:43.000
 has been threatened would scarcely take a sleeping

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:43.700
 draft.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.200
 Whatever narcotic was administered to him must have

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:52.000
 been done without his knowledge by whom obviously

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:52.500
 by McCoy.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:00.300
 Well masterman now to pass to the evidence of mrs.

02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:00.900
 Hubbard.

02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:03.400
 I was wondering how long it would be before you got

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:04.400
 around to me.

02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:04.800
 Mrs.

02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:06.500
 Hubbard has told us that lying in bed.

02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:08.700
 She was unable to see whether the communicating door

02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:09.700
 was bolted or not.

02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:13.200
 And so as Miss Olson to look for her now though,

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:15.200
 her statement may have been perfectly true.

02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:17.900
 If she had been occupying any of the even numbered

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:21.800
 compartments in the uneven numbers such as compartment

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:22.500
 number three.

02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:26.600
 3 the bolt is well above the handle and could not therefore

02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:28.300
 be masked by the sponge bag.

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.100
 I was forced to conclude that.

02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:31.500
 Mrs.

02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:35.000
 Hubbard was inventing an incident that had never

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:41.300
 occurred and now let me say a word or two about time.

02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:46.100
 I felt certain that the evidence of ratchets watch

02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:48.100
 had been deliberately faked.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:52.300
 The crime was not committed at a quarter past one.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.300
 So when did the murder take place in my opinion ratchet

02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:57.500
 was killed at some time.

02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:59.100
 Very close upon two o'clock.

02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:00.400
 The latest are the dr.

02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:02.200
 Constantine gives as possible.

02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:08.800
 Which brings us to the question of who killed him.

02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:13.200
 I was struck by the extraordinary difficulty of proving

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:16.300
 a case against any one person on the train and the Curious

02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:18.300
 coincidence that in every instance.

02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:18.700
 Each.

02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:22.900
 Alibi was confirmed by what I might describe as an

02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:26.700
 unlikely person McQueen and Colonel arbuthnot miss

02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:28.600
 debenham and miss Olsen.

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:29.100
 Mr.

02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:32.800
 Masterman and signor foscarelli or where a parent

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:33.400
 strangers.

02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:38.000
 One another I said to myself she's extraordinary.

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:45.400
 They can't all be in it and then I saw the light they

02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:48.800
 were all in it all of them.

02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:51.400
 Remember to remark of Colonel arbuthnot about trial

02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:52.200
 by jury.

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.600
 A jury is composed of 12 people.

02:09:56.700 --> 02:10:01.000
 There were 12 passengers ratchet was stabbed 12 times.

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:03.800
 Each blow was inflicted by a different person,

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:07.900
 of course ratchet had escaped Justice in America.

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:10.400
 There was no question as to his guilt.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.200
 I visualized a self-appointed jury of 12 people who

02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:16.900
 condemned ratchet to death and who were forced by

02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:20.500
 the exigencies of the case to be their own Executioner's

02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:24.700
 it was all calculated perfectly each person playing

02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:26.200
 his or her adopted part.

02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:31.700
 If I had not found that scrap of burnt letter that would

02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:34.700
 have been new crew pointed to the on strong case and

02:10:34.700 --> 02:10:37.200
 no reason for suspecting any of the passengers on

02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:37.800
 the train.

02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:40.800
 It would be put down as an outside job.

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:43.200
 And then the train ran into snow drift.

02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:46.700
 I can only imagine that the conspirators had a hasty

02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:49.500
 discussion and decided to risk everything and go

02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:54.000
 ahead even with a celebrated detective in the next

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.500
 compartment or ratchet,

02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:56.300
 but how could

02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:59.300
 could they have known who you were what other explanation

02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:00.600
 could there be for the cry?

02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.400
 I heard in the light or for the voice from ratchets

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:05.200
 compartment speaking in French.

02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:10.300
 They were staged especially for my benefit why else

02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:13.100
 go to so much trouble to plan clues that were deliberately

02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:16.700
 intended to confuse the pipe cleaner implicated

02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:19.200
 Colonel arbuthnot who appeared to have a cast-iron

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.100
 Alibi and no connection with the Armstrong family

02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:24.600
 and the handkerchief of the princess dragomiroff

02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:26.300
 who was too weak to have committed.

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:32.400
 Crime and there was one other very curious red herring

02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:35.900
 the mysterious woman the Scarlet came and she was

02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:39.500
 certainly invented specifically to deceive me and

02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:43.800
 the war was briefly pulled over my eyes.

02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:48.800
 Now there is a feather point to consider for the conspiracy

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:52.900
 to work the Vagabond e conductor had to play a part

02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:53.300
 in it,

02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:57.000
 but how could Michelle possibly be involved in this

02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:59.700
 he was a vital part of the Platinum rule book.

02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:03.800
 But that gave me such intestines instead of 12.

02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:08.400
 So out of the 13 there must have been one of the twelve

02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:10.500
 who did not strike ratchet.

02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:11.900
 Remember Monsieur Poirot.

02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:15.400
 I gave you my word of Honor that my wife did not leave

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.200
 the compartment and you are a man of Honor.

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.700
 Are you not Monsieur de combed?

02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:24.500
 It was you who struck the blow was it not but you still

02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:27.100
 haven't explained where Pierre Michel fits into

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:28.300
 all this at first.

02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:32.000
 I could not understand then I remember that the nursery

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.400
 maid who killed herself was French Survivor was utterly

02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.200
 innocent the police tried to hold her responsible

02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.100
 for what had happened.

02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:41.300
 Yes, Michelle,

02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:44.600
 your daughter had no part in the kidnapping and you

02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:44.900
 mr.

02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:48.500
 Hartman who tried so hard to convince us that you had

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:49.500
 been had by right?

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:52.100
 You loved her.

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:55.300
 Did you not she meant everything in the world to me?

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:55.600
 Mr.

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:56.100
 Poirot?

02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:01.300
 He cannot keep up with it all where does Fallen Schmidt

02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.500
 figure in all this?

02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:04.100
 I laid a little trap for her.

02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:08.100
 I said I knew she was a good cook and I replied all my

02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:12.300
 ladies have sets how stupid I was deceived by your

02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:13.800
 charm Monsieur Poirot.

02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:17.700
 You are traveling as a lady's maid for a line.

02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:19.500
 I was cooked to the Armstrong.

02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:20.600
 For three years,

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:22.300
 which leaves us with mrs.

02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:24.700
 Hubbard now mrs.

02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:27.900
 Have let me say played the most important part in the

02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:31.300
 drama by occupying the compartment communicating

02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:32.200
 with ratchet.

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:35.300
 She was more open to suspicion than anyone else to

02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:36.100
 act out the part.

02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:42.200
 She played an artist was needed and there was a great

02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.400
 artist connected with the answer on with Emily Sonia

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:45.900
 Armstrong.

02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:49.500
 Smother the famous actress Linda Arden.

02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:54.200
 I always fancied myself in comedy parts and you played

02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:54.900
 the part.

02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:56.000
 Wonderfully Madam.

02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:59.200
 Even you Monsieur Poirot can't really imagine what

02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:02.900
 it was like when terrible disaster after another.

02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:09.800
 My grandchild my daughter my son-in-law the poor

02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:10.600
 French girl.

02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:12.900
 I was crazy with grief.

02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:17.400
 We all were it would have melted a Heart of Stone Armstrong

02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:18.400
 was my best friend.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.700
 He saved my life during the war after wretched escaped

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:24.400
 the course of Justice we decided that the death sentence

02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:27.000
 had to be carried out at that stage.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.900
 There were only 11 of us Susan's father was in France,

02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:31.400
 of course,

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.600
 but the moment they approached me there was no question

02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:36.500
 of my not taking part at first.

02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:36.900
 Mr.

02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:37.400
 Powell.

02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:39.600
 We thought we should draw Lots as to who should be the

02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:41.100
 Executioner, but I said,

02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:43.200
 Let us also carry out the sentence.

02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:46.000
 So we set to work to plan exactly how we could carry

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.700
 it through but how do you fit into all this?

02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:49.000
 Mr.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:49.700
 McQueen?

02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:51.700
 That's not so easy to answer.

02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:55.600
 I suppose you could say I was in love with Sonia not

02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:56.800
 that she know anything about it.

02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:57.400
 Of course,

02:14:58.200 --> 02:14:59.300
 I worship the ground.

02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:03.500
 She walked on I took pity on the poor boy.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
 I told him to come around as often as you want there

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.100
 didn't seem any harm in it wasn't it was just enough

02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:11.200
 to

02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:14.600
 Be in her company every now and then and after she died

02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:16.200
 after my daughter died.

02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:16.400
 Mr.

02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:18.800
 McQueen did something that would have been impossible

02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:19.800
 for the rest of us.

02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:22.000
 I never let ratchet out of my sight.

02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:24.900
 I followed him all the way across Europe and the Middle

02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:27.900
 East and when he fired his secretary,

02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:31.000
 I just happened to be in the same Hotel miss you my queen.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.400
 Let us know that ratchet would be returning by the

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:34.400
 Orient Express.

02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:37.700
 It was not difficult to get myself on that train and

02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:39.500
 the Chance seemed too good to miss.

02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:41.200
 We were carrying out the sentence.

02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:44.900
 Lord failed to deliver I wasn't too keen on the idea

02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:47.500
 of stabbing a man to death but a dagger was the kind

02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:51.500
 of weapon that anyone could use strong or weak and

02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:55.000
 it made no noise and each of you in turn entered a wretched

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.200
 Stark and compartment through that of mrs.

02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:01.900
 Hubbard and struck your blow so that none of you would

02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:04.900
 ever know which wound had actually killed him.

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:05.500
 Just sir.

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:07.900
 Rather like a firing squad.

02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:11.300
 Well, you know everything now Monsieur Poirot.

02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:13.500
 What are you going to do about it?

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:17.800
 If it all really has to come out can't you lay the blame

02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.100
 on me and me only I would have stabbed that man 12 times

02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:23.600
 over very weirdly.

02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:28.100
 It's unnecessary to bring all the others into it all

02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:33.300
 these good faithful souls and pull Michelle and Mary

02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:36.000
 and Calabasas not they love each other.

02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:38.100
 but your book

02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.400
 you are director of the family company.

02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:44.100
 You have heard all the evidence.

02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:49.700
 Was it the work of a lone assassin or was it an act of

02:16:49.700 --> 02:16:53.500
 Justice carried out by 12 people in this carriage?

02:16:55.700 --> 02:17:01.400
 Well in my opinion was you blow the first theory that

02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:04.400
 you put forward was the correct one the killer left

02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:07.700
 the train at vincovci and I suggest that that is the

02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:09.800
 solution we should put to the authorities when they

02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:12.300
 arrive and what do you think dr.

02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:13.300
 Constantine?

02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:16.400
 I agree with miss you Brooke,

02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:17.400
 so

02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:22.500
 Having placed Maya solution before you I have the

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.600
 honor to retire from the case.

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:30.800
 I think that's must mean that the line is clear and

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:34.500
 we have accomplished what we set out to do Madame.

02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:39.700
 LeBrun says missile account Madame La comtesse medium

02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:44.900
 a mess you the Orient Express is about to depart.
