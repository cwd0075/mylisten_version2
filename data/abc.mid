WEBVTT

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.790
It's not in the scale of things a large question.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.290
Will I have some fish soup or another glass of Brandy

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.090
is here.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.890
I'm here,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.790
I'll have both soup and Brandi.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.290
That's the true karamazov answer.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.790
I will have both.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.990
Do you know what I've decided?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.490
I will live this life,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.390
this man's life.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.190
Like my father,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.990
I will drink the cup dry.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.390
I will seize everything everyone every woman,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.790
but then,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.590
when I'm 30,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.790
I'll, I will renounce it all

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.690
He disgusts me,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.490
sit down.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.790
He's not coming.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.990
Dmitry was hiding from us.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.690
We won't find him.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.990
We must find him.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.990
Why don't you tell me you're going to ask him to meet

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.390
you here?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.390
I don't have to tell you everything or anything.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.990
I'm Not My Brother's Keeper.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.790
You, are you believe that and what do you believe me?

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.090
I've had in my ticket.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.390
What does that mean?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.790
Engaged to that,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.790
Saint that slab of plaster.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.190
Beautiful plaster will catch you.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.190
Phone, I had started your money when you have it back.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.390
I will get it back.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.990
I must pray,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.590
I must pray that when I break into my father's bedroom

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.490
to get his money.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.890
I must pray to God.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.990
Not to someone that I don't look at his face or hear

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.890
his voice or smell him.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.190
Like spray for all that.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.990
I was praying that I don't kill him but would so love

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.790
to kill him.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.990
A cockroach

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.090
What?

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.990
It's magic off.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.790
Tell me the signals.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.390
I must get the signals right.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.590
When he opens the side door.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.990
Rushin.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.090
I'll threaten him.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.290
I won't,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.390
I won't get out.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.890
At least.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.390
The rain has stopped the.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.490
Why am I standing still talk?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.490
Talk, talk now,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.290
Act,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.990
I would so like the world to make sense,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.390
some men might know them.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.390
Well, some men love to despise love to condemn.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.090
I'm not one of those alyosha.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.690
I would like to believe.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.390
I'd like to think of a good god,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.490
a benevolent.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.190
God who hears our prayers?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.290
Listen to me,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.790
are you listening?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.990
But don't go,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.390
I think.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.190
I'm actually too tired to move.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.590
I wish we'd spent more time together as children.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.490
I might have been a different man.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.590
He separated us.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.290
Why have you seen Katerina since this morning?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.890
I will never see her again but oh,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.590
you smile.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.590
You think I'm joking?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.790
We're talking about God,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.190
you should want to talk about God.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.890
Let me tell you a story and or rather let me ask you a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.590
question every day every day.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.590
This blessed Earth.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.090
Someone lifts a stickman.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.590
They lift a stick and bring it down with

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.090
Get your bed boy.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.590
I will guard our master.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.290
Who is that?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.890
I can see where you have now run off and I'm warning,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.890
you be gone tough to interfere to meet Ray novel.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.790
Get back in the house,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.690
pull the covers over your head and sleep.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.690
I can't let you know.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.490
What have I done?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.990
What will I do now?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.690
Father, the human strength upon the body of a child.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.490
They do that.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.990
Despite the child's entreaties,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.990
despite the blood and the tears that flow,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.890
they enjoy those intimately.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.790
They do worse,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.490
things than beat and Main,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.090
the murder God allows this so that we may understand

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.990
that we have free will mmm for that important piece

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.590
of knowledge.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.790
What price would you be prepared to pay my brother?

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.490
Would you pay in the broken defiled bodies of little

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.990
innocent children now,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.490
huh?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.990
So you believe God is a less compassionate being than

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.390
you are what arrogance,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.190
what spiritual Pride,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.190
it's the sin of Satan.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.290
But we needn't trouble yourself.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.590
He doesn't exist this God or any God,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.090
we are all fans,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.190
wouldn't it be wonderful?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.190
We were sometimes.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.990
Sometimes, what when I'm kneeling saying my prayers,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.090
I feel I'm laughing at myself sniggering,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.190
what a fraud,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.790
what a Pious,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.090
little swindler,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.390
the Elder knew that about me and he said it doesn't

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.090
matter if I'm a liar self deceiver as long as I'm a good

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.590
man.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.190
What will I do when he's gone?

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.190
I don't know.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.090
Whatever I am,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.290
I'm going to be elsewhere.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.490
Let's leave this room at least that leaves only one.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.390
Something to eat later.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.590
Come on where we going.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.990
Look look at the stars on your shh.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.990
What business of ours are they?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.390
This is where our paths divide.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.990
This is it you must go in that direction.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.990
Go back to the monastery.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.390
I will find Dmitri will find him to get you've told

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.590

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.290
Very well,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.090
I will find him.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.390
It's better that I find him alone.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.890
I won't mention gotcha.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.590
I will tell him not to kill our father that I understand

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.890
exactly why his hands itch for the acts but to hold

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.590
back hold back to me tree.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.390
That's what I'll say.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.090
Nothing will happen tonight.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.690
Jody a monastery case,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.190
you're saying farewell I'm your older brother.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.190
Go, thank you.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.590
You'll do better than me meet you will listen to you

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.990
go get your Old Saint blessing.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.590
That was nice listening to you to talk.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.290
You're getting fond of him,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.790
aren't you?

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.590
What, it's only me a van,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.290
feodorovich.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.090
Only lonely me.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.790
What do you want from a jerk-off?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.190
I've come to give you a message from him or from me,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.590
sir.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.690
I wanted you to be the first to know that this evening

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.990
that I am certain that this evening

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.890
I'm repeating myself in short later on tonight.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.390
I will have an attack,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.690
so an attack of the falling sickness,

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.990
that's what we call it.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.990
You gently call it.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.690
Epilepsy, I've no time for this.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.890
I need to find Dmitri.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.790
Do you know where he is?

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.790
I'm tired.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.390
Worn out,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.690
and worried to death.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.190
And as your father asking me night and day,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.790
if she's come.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.390
If Miss Cruikshank has come,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.890
he threatens me,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.790
he beats me,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.990
I can't sleep.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.490
And there's to make tree saying,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.990
I must tell him when she comes to the house to your father.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.190
If I don't tell him,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.690
I'll be the first he'll kill.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.990
Between the two of them,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.590
they are driving me mad.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.590
I'm sorry for the doesn't matter.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.290
I don't care.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.790
Now I know about the fit

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.890
It'll happen.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.990
Just as I'm going down to The Wine Cellar.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.990
I'll for I'll be unconscious.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.690
I won't know a thing of the devil.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.790
Are you talking about?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.790
You can't predict.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.990
When you'll have a fit,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.990
I could sleep for days.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.990
After a big one,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.190
it'll be a big one.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.490
You're going to pretend to have a fit.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.790
The thing is I've told him about the signals,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.890
I've told Dimitri.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.490
Your dad sent me around her house,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.390
with a note,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.390
all the details were in the note.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.190
I can read you read a private letter how much no trouble

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.690
sir.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.690
It's not for me to criticize the Master's hand writing.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.090
The thing is the meat tree knows all about it.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.090
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.290
I told him I had to what about the signals?

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.790
He had his hands around my throat,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.790
like this look,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.190
hey, don't forget to take your crown.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.090
You'll hurt yourself.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:45.890
What?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.490
Signals.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.390
I'll tell you.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.390
I'll tell you it was crushing car.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.990
Comes

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.390
If she comes in the night,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.890
she's to wrap at your father's window like this too

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.390
quick, and too long.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.690
He won't answer to anything else.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.190
He's terrified,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.990
he's terrified of your brother.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.090
Dmitri won't do anything really for a woman like that?

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.090
It's not just the woman,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.290
sir, it's the money.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.990
He's thinking of the 3,000

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.790
in the envelope under your father's pillow.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.790
He wants that to pay back,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.990
Miss Katerina of course.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.890
It's also thinking that,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.190
if your father marries,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.790
Miss brush and kerr and he's Daft enough to do it,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.590
just for spite than,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.590
when he dies,

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.890
who gets their hands on your old,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.190
dad's Fortune mrs.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.990
Karamazov.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.290
That's who he thinks of that are Dimitri,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:36.990
never fear.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.890
You should think of that as well.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.890
Not a penny for any of you.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.790
I don't care about that.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.290
Of course,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.190
he'll do sir,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.690
of course you do,

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.090
and who can blame you.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.290
I don't want people blaming you,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.290
not for anything.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.490
So go to Moscow,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.790
the way you keep saying,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.990
leave us to Our Fate,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.990
leave me to my feet.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.290
We won't know a thing.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.290
Either of us,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.090
not a single thing about it.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.190
Whatever happens.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.090
Be safe in my cellar and you'll be in Moscow.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.790
When it happens,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.990
what happens after this is all nonsense.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.390
I'll go when it suits me.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.490
The lightning has two strikes.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.490
It does.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.990
It does.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.390
Tonight is the night.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.390
It is.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.490
I know it.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.290
Absolutely, you must save yourself.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.190
I must save you give me your arm,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.690
sir.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.490
I'll walk you to the station.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.790
Just to the station mind,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.990
you'll have to manage from there.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.490
We can't be seen together.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.390
Can we know you're exhausted?

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:48.990
You're drunk.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.790
You're heartbroken.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.490
I know about that coming home now.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.590
None of this is your responsibility.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.490
Let me help you.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.790
He blessed you.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.390
I thought I'd see him.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.690
Can you doubt that he is at this moment?

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.590
Leaning Out of Heaven watching,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.990
you watching us all.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.290
What am I to do now?

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.190
Weep some tears are sent to us by Christ and some tears

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.690
are not

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.790
Can I see they are preparing his body.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.990
When can I see you soon?

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.090
They would bring him into this room and they're ready.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.990
Wait for him here.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.590
Praying for him.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.690
Here you are.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.590
Fortunate always remember that he gave you a path.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.290
He gave you the world to work in,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.290
are ready to bring the body in fire.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.290
We will keep the vagina for an attic.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.290
Say you will stay with us this last night.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.490
Goodbye my father.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.290
Amen.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.590
Rest in peace.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:29.690
They say,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.790
when they buried on the bus on,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.590
if he was quite untouched.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.090
After three days,

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.390
utterly uncorrupted,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.490
and the spill they said,

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:36.990
was like,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.890
roses blessed,

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.690
be the name of God and hope you're late.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.990
They have a new saved their company.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.290
A boy was not held and indeed he was at that night and

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.290
when his way home to her,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:52.790
it's a miracle overlooking their sins where the committed

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.990
in knowledge or in ignorance.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.590
Grant them.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.890
That's a nice little sweetness.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.890
Unita night is nearly of joy and preserve Us in the

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.090
remission of sins.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.890
What are you doing?

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.190
Forgive me.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.290
Father, it is just a little difficult.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.590
What is difficult?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.590
It is difficult to breathe.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.390
Father, it is the smell of bodily.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.190
Corruption of pollution.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.190
What does that mean?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.790
It means we were deceived.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.390
He was not to Holy money,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.590
even an Audrey seller would not real wrought.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.890
So soon after death,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.390
it is a cipher godchaux,

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.990
very be silent.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.090
Will you give the unbelievers cause to mock us to triumph

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:42.490
over us?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.290
No one will speak of this.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.090
He was not a saint.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.190
There are hundreds of the faithful outside.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.490
The walls of the monastery,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.790
took thousands this very day.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.790
Do you want to fill them with doubt and confusion?

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.990
Elder zosima was a servant of God.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.990
He was a servant of God Alexa he loved you speak.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.790
He was a servant of God.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.290
A saint,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.390
thank you.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.890
But the truth is he stinks,

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.790
he stinks to high heaven.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.290
I'd like to say

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.590
What do you want to use to me,

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.090
I pay your wages.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.290
What do you want?

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:46.790
Miss?

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.590
Screw Shankar.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.990
I don't know.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.990
I don't know what I want.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.690
That's a problem.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.990
A transformation.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.890
A total transformation that we do.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.490
Failing that I would just like something to happen.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.990
I'm bored.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.190
Oh no.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.390
Not that.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.090
Well, sorry,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.690
I'll bet a rosary.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.890
It keep one of the panel's out of the door last week.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.390
How do you know?

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.790
It's Dimitri question.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.890
You'll be me that will fill the first Blood.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.990
He's not letting quickly.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.090
Let's do it then I suppose we will have.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.290
They have champagne.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.190
Bring it.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.490
Well, it seems I was wrong.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.090
Better.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.790
How do you do this?

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.390
A for your daughter?

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.190
A bitch.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.590
Bring that chair over for mr.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.590
Karamazov I want you to stick close to me.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.490
Okay, tell me.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.390
What are you doing here?

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.490
A little Monk

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.390
He's dead defend us.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.490
Oh God.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.290
Defend us.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.990
I never thought it would come to this meet you.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.190
What have you done?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.590
Come on a street in an uproar.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.590
He was supposed to be a saint a holy man,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.490
but he lay there in his coffin and he smelt,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.890
like any dead thing was horrible,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.790
your Elder is dead.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.790
Oh, thank God what I thought they had killed.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.290
Never mind.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.990
What you doing here in my house?

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.290
I don't know.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.290
I thought perhaps you would comfort me Comfort.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.590
You I'm not here for that.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.590
That's not why you came.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.790
Is it be honest Alexei?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.890
You came for something else.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.490
I see it in your face.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.990
Just do all that champagne.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.790
Oh yes!

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.290
Two bottles as quickly as you can go on.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.690
And the drunk champagne.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.590
Yeah.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.890
Would you like to hold my hand?

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:18.990
Thank you.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.990
Would you like to kiss my hand?

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.390
I think I'd better have some champagne first wise,

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.090
boy.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.290
What are you waiting for go mistress long ago.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.290
When I first came here,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.190

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.390
individual, if a message came from him,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:54.990
no matter what,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.990
the circumstances,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.290
no matter who was with you,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.390
I was to come immediately.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.290
No, I shouldn't even person who sent the messenger.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.990
He's at the kitchen door with a letter.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.690
Bring it here.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:09.890
Now, would you like me to leave?

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.990
I don't care what you do.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.490
Why is he sent me a message?

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.090
Why now,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.590
can it really be from him whose letter from my lover?

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.490
My first,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.790
my real lover.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.690
I was 17.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.790
Oh hell I loved him.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.790
My handsome officer.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.890
How could I resist him?

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.390
He promised me,

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.190
we would marry.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.690
And then he was gone.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.590
I was a different person,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:46.990
then.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.090
Do you think I was always like this.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.590
Oh, why is he written after all these years?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.490
It was a message.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.990
Mistress, what you see from him?

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:56.890
Is he?

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.790
Well, tell me is,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.190
well, he's not dying.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:18:59.590
I am.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.890
It was his wife died months ago.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.190
Apparently, here it is.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:04.990
Forgive me,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.690
forgive yourself come.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.690
What a wonderful letter read it.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.990
Pretty intense.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.390
He's polish,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:17.890
you know,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.590
is he?

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.590
Well, yes,

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.190
I suppose that is obvious from the spelling.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.690
Do I go,

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.990
do I run out into the rain to be with a man?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.690
I have not seen for five years.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.190
Do I go to kiss the hands of my betrayer answer?

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.190
Me, that Alexei for your daughter of it.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.290
Why didn't you come for you in person?

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.390
He wants me to risk myself to show my courage.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.090
He doesn't really ask for your forgiveness.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.190
I don't want to forgive him.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.790
I want to love him.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.990
What will I tell Mitchell?

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.990
Tell him to go to the devil and to take his father with

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.390
him?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.390
I am not a bone to be worried by to dirty dogs.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.190
A new life is waiting for me.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.290
Tell his messenger,

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:03.990
I will come.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.890
I will come to him this very night,

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.390
why not?

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.090
Absolutely,

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.690
What a lucky Escape you had tonight.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.690
I might well have decided to make love to you.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.390
You're very handsome don't blush.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.590
But now I'm redeemed.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.690
Cool boy.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.890
Now I am virtuous woman.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.190
You have missed your chance.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.990
You're right to laugh at me.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.490
Am I laughing at you?

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.990
I shouldn't

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.590
This is my chance.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.690
I can't believe that you sent for me,

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.190
kiss me,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:44.990
if you like,

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.890
I may never see you again.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.790
I think I'd better not.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.990
I will kiss you anyway,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.590
Oh, you're sir farewell.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.490
Gone.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.890
Don't know,

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.390
leave the bottles.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.390
Look at him,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.490
preening of to the mirror.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.790
I can see you.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.990
He must think she will come tonight.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.690
I think my darling,

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.890

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.790

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:47.490
And slab of last beautiful plaster will catch you.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:48.990
Phone.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.490

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.690
I will get it back.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.290
I must pray,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.890
I must pray that when I break into my father's bedroom

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.890
to get his money,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:08.790
I must pray to my to someone that I don't look at his

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.290
face or hear his voice or smell him like spray for all

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:13.490
that.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.790
I must pray that I don't kill him.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.090
What would so love to kill him?

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.290
A cockroach

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:22.390

I must get the signals right.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.890
When he opens the side door.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.290
Rushin.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.390
I'll threaten him.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.590
I won't,

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.690
I won't get out.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.290
At least the rain has stopped.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.790
Why am I standing still talk?

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.490
